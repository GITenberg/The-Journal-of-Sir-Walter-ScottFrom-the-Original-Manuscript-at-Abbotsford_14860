<p><i>July</i> 1, [<i>Abbotsford</i>].&mdash;A most delicious day, in the course of which
I have not done</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The least right thing.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before breakfast I employed myself in airing my old bibliomaniacal
hobby, entering all the books lately acquired into a temporary
catalogue, so as to have them shelved and marked. After breakfast I went
out, the day being delightful&mdash;warm, yet cooled with a gentle breeze,
all around delicious; the rich luxuriant green refreshing to the eye,
soft to the tread, and perfume to the smell. Wandered about and looked
at my plantations. Came home, and received a visit from Sir Adam.
Loitered in the library till dinner-time. If there is anything to be
done at all to-day, it must be in the evening. But I fear there will be
nothing. One can't work always <i>nowther</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;<i>Neque semper arcum tendit Apollo</i>.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There's warrant for it.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 2.&mdash;Wrote in the morning, correcting the Essay on the Highlands,
which is now nearly completed. Settled accounts with Tom and Bogie. Went
over to Huntly Burn at two o'clock, and reconnoitred the proposed
plantation to be called Jane's Wood. Dined with the Fergusons.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 3&mdash;- Worked in the morning upon the Introduction to the
<i>Chronicles</i>; it may be thought egotistical. Learned a bad accident had
happened yesterday. A tinker (drunk I suppose) entered the stream
opposite to Faldonside with an ass bearing his children. The ass was
carried down by the <a name="Page_2"></a>force of the stream, and one of the little
creatures was drowned; the other was brought out alive, poor innocent,
clinging to the ass. It had floated as far down as Deadwater-heugh. Poor
thing, it is as well dead as to live a tinker! The Fergusons dine with
us <i>en masse</i>; also Dr. Brewster.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 4, [<i>Edinburgh</i>].&mdash;Worked a little in the morning, and took a
walk after breakfast, the day so delicious as makes it heart-breaking to
leave the country. Set out, however, about four o'clock, and reached
Edinburgh a little after nine. Slept part of the way; read <i>De Vere</i> the
rest.<a name="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> It is well written, in point of language and sentiment, but has
too little action in it to be termed a pleasing novel. Everything is
brought out by dialogue&mdash;or worse: through the medium of the author's
reflections, which is the clumsiest of all expedients.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 5.&mdash;This morning worked, and sent off to J.B. the Introduction to
the <i>Chronicles</i>, containing my Confessions,<a name="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and did something, but
not fluently, to the Confessions themselves. Not happy, however; the
black dog worries me. Bile, I suppose. &quot;But I will rally and combat the
reiver.&quot; Reiver it is, that wretched malady of the mind; got quite well
in the forenoon. Went out to Portobello after dinner, and chatted with
little Johnnie, and told him the history of the Field of Prestonpans.
Few remain who care about these stories.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 6.&mdash;This morning wrought a good deal, but scarce a task. The
Court lasted till half-past three; exhausting work in this hot weather.
I returned to dine alone, Anne going to Roslin with a party. After noon
a Miss Bell broke in upon me, who bothered me some time since about a
book of hers, explaining and exposing the conduct of a Methodist
Tartuffe, who had broken off (by anonymous letters) a match <a name="Page_3"></a>betwixt her
and an accepted admirer. Tried in vain to make her comprehend how little
the Edinburgh people would care about her wrongs, since there was no
knowledge of the parties to make the scandal acceptable. I believe she
has suffered great wrong.<a name="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Letter from Longman and Co. to J.B.
grumbling about bringing out the second edition, because they have,
forsooth, 700 copies in hand out of 5000, five days after the first
edition<a name="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> is out. What would they have? It is uncomfortable, though.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 7.&mdash;Night dreadfully warm, and bilious; I could not be fool
enough surely to be anxious for these wise men of the East's
prognostication. Letters from Lockhart give a very cheerful prospect; if
there had been any thundering upsetting broadside, he would have noticed
it surely more or less. R. Cadell quite stout, and determined to go on
with the second edition. Well, I hope all's right&mdash;thinking won't help
it. Charles came down this morning penniless, poor fellow, but we will
soon remedy that. Lockhart remits &pound;100 for reviewing; I hope the next
will be for Sophia, for cash affairs loom well in the offing, and if the
trust funds go right, I was never so easy. I will take care how I get
into debt again. I do not like this croaking of these old owls of Saint
Paul's when all is done. The pitcher has gone often to the well.
But&mdash;However, I worked away at the <i>Chronicles</i>. I will take pains with
them. I will, by Jove!</p>

<p><i>July</i> 8.&mdash;I did little to-day but arrange papers, and put bills,
receipts, etc., into apple-pie order. I believe the fair prospect I have
of clearing off some encumbrances, which are like thorns in my flesh,
nay, in my very eye, contribute much to this. I did not even correct
proof-sheets; nay, could not, for I have cancelled two sheets, <i>instante
Jacobo</i>, and I myself being of his opinion; for, as I said yesterday, we
must and will take pains. The fiddle-faddle of arranging all the things
was troublesome, but they give a good account <a name="Page_4"></a>of my affairs. The money
for the necessary payments is ready, and therefore there is a sort of
pleasure which does not arise out of any mean source, since it has for
its object the prospect of doing justice and achieving independence.
J.B. dined with me, poor fellow, and talked of his views as hopeful and
prosperous. God send honest industry a fair riddance.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 9.&mdash;Wrote in the morning. At eleven went by appointment with
Colin Mackenzie to the New Edinburgh Academy. In the fifth class, Mr.
Mitchell's, we heard Greek, of which I am no otherwise a judge than that
it was fluently read and explained. In the rector Mr. Williams's class
we heard Virgil and Livy admirably translated <i>ad aperturam libri</i>, and,
what I thought remarkable, the rector giving the English, and the pupils
returning, with singular dexterity, the Latin, not exactly as in the
original, but often by synonymes, which showed that the exercise
referred to the judgment, and did not depend on the memory. I could not
help saying, with great truth, that, as we had all long known how much
the pupils were fortunate in a rector, so we were now taught that the
rector was equally lucky in his pupils. Of my young friends, I saw a son
of John Swinton, a son of Johnstone of Alva, and a son of Craufurd
Tait.<a name="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Dined at John Murray's; Mr. and Mrs. Philips of Liverpool,
General and Charles Stuart of Blantyre, Lord Abercromby, Clerk and
Thomson. Pleasant evening.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 10.&mdash;Corrected proofs, but wrote nothing. To Court till two
o'clock. I went to Cadell's by the Mound, a long roundabout; transacted
some business. I met Baron Hume coming home, and walked with him in the
Gardens. His remarkable account of his celebrated uncle's last moments
is in these words:&mdash;Dr. Black called on Mr. D. Hume<a name="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> on the morning on
which he died. The patient complained of having suffered a great deal
during the night, and expressed a <a name="Page_5"></a>fear that his struggle might be
prolonged, to his great distress, for days or weeks longer. &quot;No, sir,&quot;
said Dr. Black, with the remarkable calmness and sincerity which
characterised him, &quot;I have examined the symptoms, and observe several
which oblige me to conclude that dissolution is rapidly approaching.&quot;
&quot;Are you certain of that, Doctor?&quot; &quot;Most assuredly so,&quot; answered the
physician. The dying philosopher extended his arm, and shook hands with
his medical friend. &quot;I thank you,&quot; he said, &quot;for the news.&quot; So little
reason there was for the reports of his having been troubled in mind
when on his deathbed.</p>

<p>Dined at Lord Abercromby's, to meet Lord Melville in private. We had an
interview betwixt dinner and tea. I was sorry to see my very old friend,
this upright statesman and honourable gentleman, deprived of his power
and his official income, which the number of his family must render a
matter of importance. He was cheerful, not affectedly so, and bore his
declension like a wise and brave man. I had nursed the idea that he had
been hasty in his resignation; but, from the letters which he showed me
confidentially, which passed betwixt him and Canning, it is clear his
resignation was to be accomplished, not I suppose for personal
considerations, but because it rendered the Admiralty vacant for the
Duke of Clarence, as his resignation was eagerly snapped at. It cannot
be doubted that if he had hesitated or hung back behind his friends,
forcible means would have been used to compel to the measure, which with
more dignity he took of his own accord&mdash;at least so it seemed to me. The
first intimation which Lord Melville received of his successor was
through Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, who told him, as great news, that there was to be a new
Duke of York<a name="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. Lord M. understood <a name="Page_6"></a>the allusion so little, as to
inquire whether his informant meant that the Duke of Cambridge had taken
the Duke of York's situation, when it was explained to refer to the Duke
of Clarence getting the Admiralty. There are some few words that speak
volumes. Lord Melville said that none of them suspected Canning's
negotiations with the Whigs but the Duke of Wellington, who found it out
through the ladies ten days before. I asked him how they came to be so
unprepared, and could not help saying I thought they had acted without
consideration, and that they might have shown a face even to Canning. He
allowed the truth of what I said, and seemed to blame Peel's want of
courage. In his place, he said, he would have proposed to form a
government disclaiming any personal views for himself as being Premier
and the like, but upon the principle of supporting the measures of Lord
Castlereagh and Lord Liverpool. I think this would have been acceptable
to the King. Mr. Peel obviously feared his great antagonist Canning, and
perhaps threw the game up too soon. Canning said the office of Premier
was his inheritance; he could not, from constitution, hold it above two
years, and then it would descend to Peel. Such is ambition! Old friends
forsaken&mdash;old principles changed&mdash;every effort used to give the vessel
of the State a new direction, and all to be Palinurus for two years!</p>

<p><i>July</i> 11, [<i>Abbotsford</i>].&mdash;Worked at proofs in the morning; composed
nothing. Got off by one, and to this place between six and seven.
Weather delicious.</p>

<p><i>July 12</i>.&mdash;Unpacking and arranging; the urchins are stealing the
cherries in the outer garden. But I can spare a thousand larch-trees to
put it in order with a good fence for next year. It is not right to
leave fruit exposed; for if Adam in the days of innocence fell by an
apple, how <a name="Page_7"></a>much may the little <i>gossoon</i> Jamie Moffatt be tempted by
apples of gold in an age of iron! Anne and I walked to Huntly Burn&mdash;a
delicious excursion. That place is really become beautiful; the Miss
Fergusons have displayed a great deal of taste.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 13.&mdash;Two agreeable persons&mdash;Rev. Mr. Gilly<a name="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, one of the
prebendaries of Durham, with his wife, a pretty little woman&mdash;dined with
us, and met Mr. Scrope. I heard the whole history of the discovery of
St. Cuthbert's<a name="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> body at Durham Cathedral. The Catholics will deny the
identity, of course; but I think it is <i>constat&eacute;</i> by the dress and other
circumstances. Made a pleasant day of it, and with a good conscience,
for I had done my task this morning.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 14.&mdash;Did task this morning, and believe that I shall get on now
very well. Wrote about five leaves. I have been baking and fevering
myself like a fool for these two years in a room exposed to the south;
comfortable in winter, but broiling in the hot weather. Now I have
removed myself into the large cool library, one of the most refreshing
as well as handsomest rooms in Scotland, and will not use the study
again till the heats are past. Here is an entry as solemn as if it
respected the Vicar of Wakefield's removal from the yellow room to the
brown. But I think my labours will advance greatly in consequence of
this arrangement. Walked in the evening to the lake.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 15.&mdash;Achieved six pages to-day, and finished volume i. of
<i>Chronicles</i>. It is rather long; but I think the last story interesting,
and it should not be split up into parts. J.B. will, I fear, think it
low; and if he thinks so, others will. Yet&mdash;vamos. Drove to Huntly Burn
in the evening.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 16.&mdash;Made a good morning's work of the <i>Tales</i>. In the day-time
corrected various proofs. J.B. thinks that <a name="Page_8"></a>in the proposed introduction
I contemn too much the occupation by which I have thriven so well, and
hints that I may easily lead other people to follow my opinion in
vilipending my talents, and the use I have made of them. I cannot tell.
I do not like, on the one hand, to suppress my own opinion of the
<i>flocci-pauci-nihili-pilification</i> with which I regard these things; but
yet, in duty to others, I cannot afford to break my own bow, or befoul
my own nest, and there may be something like affectation and <i>nolo
episcopari</i> in seeming to underrate my own labours; so, all things
considered, I will erase the passage. Truth should not be spoke at all
times. In the evening we had a delightful drive to Ashestiel with
Colonel and Miss Ferguson.</p>

<p><i>July 17</i>.&mdash;I wrote a laborious task; seven pages of <i>Tales</i>. Kept about
the doors all day. Gave Bogie &pound;10 to buy cattle to-morrow at St.
Boswell's Fair. Here is a whimsical subject of affliction. Mr. Harper, a
settler, who went from this country to Botany Bay, thinking himself
obliged to me for a recommendation to General M'Allister and Sir Thomas
Brisbane, has thought proper to bring me home a couple of Emus. I wish
his gratitude had either taken a different turn, or remained as
quiescent as that of others whom I have obliged more materially. I at
first accepted the creatures, conceiving them, in my ignorance, to be
some sort of blue and green parrot, which, though I do not admire their
noise, might scream and yell at their pleasure if hung up in the hall
among the armour. But your emu, it seems, stands six feet high on his
stocking soles, and is little better than a kind of cassowary or
ostrich. Hang them! they might [eat] up my collection of old arms for
what I know. It reminds me of the story of the adjutant birds in
Theodore Hook's novel<a name="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. No; I'll no Emuses!</p>

<p><i>July 18</i>.&mdash;Entered this morning on the history of Sir William Wallace.
I wish I may be able to find my way <a name="Page_9"></a>between what the child can
comprehend and what shall not yet be absolutely uninteresting to the
grown readers. Uncommon facts I should think the best receipt. Learn
that Mr. Owen Rees and John Gibson have amicably settled their
differences about the last edition of <i>Napoleon</i>, the Trustees allowing
the publishers nine months' credit. My nerves have for these two or
three last days been susceptible of an acute excitement from the
slightest causes; the beauty of the evening, the sighing of the summer
breeze, brings the tears into my eyes not unpleasingly. But I must take
exercise, and caseharden myself. There is no use in encouraging these
moods of the mind. It is not the law we live on.</p>

<p>We had a little party with some luncheon at the lake, where Mr.
Bainbridge fished without much success. Captain Hamilton and two Messrs.
Stirling, relatives of my old friend Keir, were there, and walked with
me a long round home. I walked better than I had done for some days. Mr.
Scrope dined with us; he was complaining of gout, which is a bad
companion for the stag-shooting.</p>

<p><i>July 19</i>.&mdash;I made out my task this forenoon, and a good deal more. Sent
five or six pages to James Ballantyne, <i>i.e.</i> got them ready, and wrote
till the afternoon, then I drove over to Huntly Burn, and walked through
the glens till dinner-time. After dinner read and worked till bed-time.
Yet I have written well, walked well, talked well, and have nothing to
regret.</p>

<p><i>July 20</i>.&mdash;Despatched my letters to J.B., with supply of copy, and made
up more than my task&mdash;about four leaves, I think. Offered my Emuses to
the Duke of Buccleuch. I had an appointment with Captain Hamilton and
his friends the Stirlings, that they were to go up Yarrow to-day. But
the weather seems to say no.</p>

<p>My visitors came, however, and we went up to Newark. Here is a little
misfortune, for Spice left me, and we could not find her. As we had no
servant with us on horseback,<a name="Page_10"></a> I was compelled to leave her to her fate,
resolving to send in quest of her to-morrow morning. The keepers are my
<i>bonos socios</i>, as the host says in the Devil of Edmonton<a name="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>, and would
as soon shoot a child as a dog of mine. But there are scamps and traps,
and I am ashamed to say how reluctantly I left the poor little terrier
to its fate.</p>

<p>She came home to me, however, about an hour and a half after we were
home, to my great delectation. Our visitors dined with us.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 21.&mdash;This morning wrote five pages of children's history. Went to
Minto, where we met, besides Lord M. and his delightful countess, Thomas
Thomson, Kennedy of Dunure<a name="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>, Lord Carnarvon, and his younger son and
daughter-in-law; the dowager Lady Minto also, whom I always delight to
see, she is so full of spirit and intelligence. We rubbed up some
recollections of twenty years ago, when I was more intimate with the
family till Whig and Tory separated us for a time. By the way, nobody
talks Whig or Tory just now, and the fighting men on each side go about
muzzled and mute like dogs after a proclamation about canine madness. Am
I sorry for this truce or not? Half and half. It is all we have left to
stir the blood, this little political brawling; but better too little of
it than too much.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 22, [<i>Abbotsford</i>].&mdash;Rose a little later than usual, and wrote a
letter to Mrs. Joanna Baillie. She is writing a tragedy<a name="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> on
witchcraft. I shall be curious to see it. Will it be real
witchcraft&mdash;the <i>ipsissimus diabolus</i>&mdash;or an impostor, or the
half-crazed being who believes herself an ally of condemned spirits, and
desires to be so? That last is a sublime subject. We set out after
breakfast, and reached this about <a name="Page_11"></a>two. I walked from two till four;
chatted a long time with Charles after dinner, and thus went my day
<i>sine linea</i>. But we will make it up. James Ballantyne dislikes my
&quot;Drovers.&quot; But it shall stand. I must have my own way sometimes.</p>

<p>I received news of two deaths at once: Lady Die Scott, my very old
friend, and Archibald Constable, the bookseller.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 23.&mdash;Yes! they are both for very different reasons subjects of
reflection. Lady Diana Scott, widow of Walter Scott of Harden, was the
last person whom I recollect so much older than myself, that she kept
always at the same distance in point of years, so that she scarce seemed
older to me (relatively) two years ago, when in her ninety-second year,
than fifty years before. She was the daughter (alone remaining) of
Pope's Earl of Marchmont, and, like her father, had an acute mind and an
eager temper. She was always kind to me, remarkably so indeed when I was
a boy.</p>

<p>Constable's death might have been a most important thing to me if it had
happened some years ago, and I should then have lamented it much. He has
lived to do me some injury; yet, excepting the last &pound;5000, I think most
unintentionally. He was a prince of booksellers; his views sharp,
powerful, and liberal; too sanguine, however, and, like many bold and
successful schemers, never knowing when to stand or stop, and not always
calculating his means to his objects with mercantile accuracy. He was
very vain, for which he had some reason, having raised himself to great
commercial eminence, as he might also have attained great wealth with
good management. He knew, I think, more of the business of a bookseller
in planning and executing popular works than any man of his time. In
books themselves he had much bibliographical information, but none
whatever that could be termed literary. He knew the rare volumes of his
library not only by the eye, but by the touch, when blindfolded. Thomas
Thomson saw him make this experiment, and, that it might be complete,
placed in his <a name="Page_12"></a>hand an ordinary volume instead of one of these <i>libri
rariores</i>. He said he had over-estimated his memory; he could not
recollect that volume. Constable was a violent-tempered man with those
that he dared use freedom with. He was easily overawed by people of
consequence, but, as usual, took it out of those whom poverty made
subservient to him. Yet he was generous, and far from bad-hearted. In
person good-looking, but very corpulent latterly; a large feeder, and
deep drinker, till his health became weak. He died of water in the
chest, which the natural strength of his constitution set long at
defiance. I have no great reason to regret him; yet I do. If he deceived
me, he also deceived himself.<a name="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_13"></a>
<p>Wrote five pages to-day, and went to see Mr. Scrope, who is fast with
the gout&mdash;a bad companion to attend him</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i13">&quot;to Athole Braes,<br /></span>
<span>To shoot the dun deer down, down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>To shoot the dun deer down.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>July</i> 24.&mdash;Finished five pages before eleven o'clock, at which time Mr.
Deputy Register<a name="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> arrived from Minto, and we had an agreeable
afternoon, talking about the old days we have had together. I was
surprised to find that Thomson knew as little as I do myself how to
advise Charles to a good course of Scottish History. Hailes and
Pinkerton, Robertson and Laing&mdash;there is nothing else for it&mdash;and
Pinkerton is poor work. Laing, besides his party spirit, has a turn for
generalising, which renders him rather dull, which was not the nature of
the acute Orcadian.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 25.&mdash;Thomson left us this morning early. I finished four pages,
and part of a fifth, then drove to Huntly Burn and returned through the
Glen; I certainly turn <i>heavy-footed</i>, not in the female sense, however.
I had one or two falls among the slippy heather, not having Tom Purdie
to give me his arm. I suppose I shall need a go-cart one of these days;
and if it must be so&mdash;so let it be. <i>Fiat voluntas tua</i>.</p>

<p>A letter from John Gibson in the evening brought me word that Lord
Newton had adjudged the profits of <i>Woodstock</i> and <i>Napoleon</i> to be my
own. This is a great matter, and removes the most important part of my
dispute with Constable's creditors. I waked in the middle of the night.
Sure I am not such a feather-headed gull as not to be able to sleep for
good news. I am thankful that it is as it is. Had it been otherwise, I
could have stood it. The money realised will pay one-third of all that I
owe in the world&mdash;and what will <a name="Page_14"></a>pay the other two-thirds? I am as well
and as capable as when those misfortunes began&mdash;January was a year. The
public favour may wane, indeed, but it has not failed as yet, and I must
not be too anxious about that possibility.</p>

<p>James B. has found fault with my tales for being too historical;
formerly it was for being too infantine. He calls out for starch, and is
afraid of his cravat being too stiff. O ye critics, will nothing melt
ye?</p>

<p><i>July</i> 26.&mdash;Wrote till one o'clock, and finished the first volume of
<i>Tales</i>&mdash;about six leaves. To-morrow I resume the <i>Chronicles</i>, tooth
and nail. They must be good, if possible. After all, works of fiction,
viz., cursed lies, are easier to write, and much more popular than the
best truths. Walked over to the head of the Roman road, coming round by
Bauchland and the Abbot's Walk. Wrote letters in the evening.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 27.&mdash;In the morning still busied with my correspondence. No great
desire to take up the <i>Chronicles</i>. But it must be done. Devil take the
necessity, and the folly and knavery, that occasioned it! But this is no
matter now. Accordingly I set tightly to work, and got on till two, when
I took a walk. Was made very happy by the arrival of Sophia and her
babies, all in good health and spirits.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 28.&mdash;Worked hard in the morning. The two Ballantynes, and Mr.
Hogarth with them. Owen Rees came early in the day. Fergusons came to
dinner. Rees in great kindness and good-humour, but a little drumlie, I
think, about <i>Napoleon</i>. We heard Sandie's violin after dinner&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;Whose touch harmonious can remove<br /></span>
<span>The pangs of guilty power and hopeless love.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I do not understand or care about fine music; but there is something in
his violin which goes to the very heart. Sophia sung too, and we were
once more merry in hall&mdash;the first time for this many a month and many a
day.</p>

<p><a name="Page_15"></a><i>July</i> 29.&mdash;Could not do more than undertake my proofs to-day, of which
J.B. has brought out a considerable quantity. Walked at one with Hogarth
and Rees&mdash;the day sultry, hot, and we hot accordingly, but crept about
notwithstanding. I am sorry to see my old and feal friend James rather
unable to walk&mdash;once so stout and active&mdash;so was I in my way <i>once</i>. Ah!
that vile word, what a world of loss it involves!</p>

<p><i>July</i> 30.&mdash;One of the most peppering thunder-storms which I have heard
for some time. Routed and roared from six in the morning till eight
continuously.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The thunder ceased not, nor the fire reposed;<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Well done, old Botherby.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Time wasted, though very agreeably, after breakfast. At noon, set out
for Chiefswood in the carriage, and walked home, footing it over rough
and smooth, with the vigour of early days. James Ballantyne marched on
too, somewhat meltingly, but without complaint. We again had beautiful
music after dinner. The heart of age arose. I have often wondered
whether I have a taste for music or no. My ear appears to me as dull as
my voice is incapable of musical expression, and yet I feel the utmost
pleasure in any such music as I can comprehend, learned pieces always
excepted. I believe I may be about the pitch of Terry's connoisseurship,
and that &quot;I have a reasonable good ear for a jig, but your solos and
sonatas give me the spleen.&quot;</p>

<p><i>July</i> 31.&mdash;Employed the morning writing letters and correcting proofs;
this is the second day and scarce a line written, but circumstances are
so much my apology that even Duty does not murmur, at least not <i>much</i>.
We had a drive up to Galashiels, and sent J.B. off to Edinburgh in the
Mail. Music in the evening as before.</p><a name="Page_16"></a>

<a name="AUGUST_1827"></a><h2>AUGUST.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>August</i> 1.&mdash;My guests left me and I thought of turning to work again
seriously. Finished five pages. Dined alone, excepting Huntly Gordon,
who is come on a visit, poor lad. I hope he is well fixed under Mr.
Planta's<a name="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> patronage. Smoked a cigar after dinner. Laughed with my
daughters, and read them the review of Hoffmann's production out of
Gillies's new <i>Foreign Review</i>.</p>

<p>The undertaking would do, I am convinced, in any other person's hands
than those of the improvident editor; but I hear he is living as
thoughtlessly as ever in London, has hired a large house, and gives
Burgundy to his guests. This will hardly suit &pound;500 a year.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 2.&mdash;Got off my proofs. Went over to breakfast at Huntly Burn;
the great object was to see my cascade in the Glen suitably repaired. I
have had it put to rights by puddling and damming. What says the frog in
the Fairy Tale?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Stuff with moss, and clog with clay,<br /></span>
<span>And that will weize the water away.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Having seen the job pretty tightly done, walked deliciously home through
the woods. But no work all this while. Then for up and at it. But in
spite of good resolutions I trifled with my children after dinner, and
read to them in the evening, and did just nothing at all.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 3.&mdash;Wrote five pages and upwards&mdash;scarce amends for past
laziness. Huntly Gordon lent me a volume of his father's manuscript
memoirs.<a name="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> They are not without interest, for Pryse Gordon, though a
bit of a <i>rou&eacute;</i>, is a clever fellow in <a name="Page_17"></a>his way. One thing struck me,
being the story of an Irish swindler, who called himself Henry King
Edgeworth, an impudent gawsey fellow, who deserted from Gordon's
recruiting party, enlisted again, and became so great a favourite with
the Colonel of the regiment which he joined, that he was made
pay-sergeant. Here he deserted to purpose with &pound;200 or &pound;300, escaped to
France, got a commission in the Corps sent to invade Ireland, was taken,
recognised, and hanged. What would Mr. Theobald Wolfe Tone have said to
such an associate in his regenerating expedition? These are thy gods, O
Israel! The other was the displeasure of the present Cameron of Lochiel,
on finding that the forty Camerons, with whom he joined the Duke of
Gordon's Northern Fencible regiment, were to be dispersed. He had
wellnigh mutinied and marched back with them. This would be a good
anecdote for Garth.<a name="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>August</i> 4.&mdash;Spent the morning at Selkirk, examining people about an
assault. When I returned I found Charlotte Kerr here with a clever
little boy, Charles Scott, grandson of Charles of the Woll, and son of
William, and grand-nephew of John of Midgehope. He seems a smart boy,
and, considering that he is an only son with expectations, not <i>too</i>
much spoiled. General Yermoloff called with a letter from a Dr. Knox,
whom I do not know. If it be Vicesimus, we met nearly twenty-five years
ago and did not agree. But General Yermoloff's name was luckily known to
me. He is a man in the flower of life, about thirty, handsome, bold, and
enthusiastic; a great admirer of poetry, and all that. He had been in
the Moscow campaign, and those which followed, but must have been very
young. He made not the least doubt that Moscow was burned by Rostopchin,
and said that there was a general rumour before the French entered the
<a name="Page_18"></a>town, and while the inhabitants were leaving it, that persons were left
to destroy it. I asked him why the magazine of gunpowder had not been
set fire to in the first instance. He answered that he believed the
explosion of that magazine would have endangered the retreating
Russians. This seemed unsatisfactory. The march of the Russians was too
distant from Moscow to be annoyed by the circumstance. I pressed him as
well as I could about the slowness of Koutousoff's operations; and he
frankly owned that the Russians were so much rejoiced and surprised to
see the French in retreat, that it was long ere they could credit the
extent of the advantage which they had acquired. This has been but an
idle day, so far as composition is concerned, but I was detained late at
Selkirk.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 5.&mdash;Wrote near six pages. General Yermoloff left me with many
expressions of enthusiastic regard, as foreigners use to do. He is a
kinsman of Princess Galitzin, whom I saw at Paris. I walked with Tom
after one o'clock. Dined <i>en famille</i> with Miss Todd, a pretty girl, and
wrote after dinner.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 6.&mdash;This morning finished proofs and was <i>bang up</i> with
everything. When I was about to sit down to write, I have the agreeable
tidings that Henderson, the fellow who committed the assault at Selkirk,
and who made his escape from the officers on Saturday, was retaken, and
that it became necessary that I should go up to examine him. Returned at
four, and found Mrs. George Swinton from Calcutta, to whose husband I
have been much obliged, with Archie and cousin Peggie Swinton, arrived.
So the evening was done up.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 7.&mdash;Cousins still continuing, we went to Melrose. I finished,
however, in the first place, a pretty smart task, which is so far well,
as we expect the Skenes to-morrow. Lockhart arrived from London. The
news are that Canning is dangerously ill. This is the bowl being broken
at the cistern with a vengeance. If he dies now, it will be pity <a name="Page_19"></a>it was
not five months ago. The time has been enough to do much evil, but not
to do any-permanent good.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 8.&mdash;Huntly Gordon proposed to me that I should give him my
correspondence, which we had begun to arrange last year. I resolved not
to lose the opportunity, and began to look out and arrange the letters
from about 1810, throwing out letters of business and such as are
private. They are of little consequence, generally speaking, yet will be
one day curious. I propose to have them bound up, to save trouble. It is
a sad task; how many dead, absent, estranged, and altered! I wrought
till the Skenes came at four o'clock. I love them well; yet I wish their
visit had been made last week, when other people were here. It kills
time, or rather murders it, this company-keeping. Yet what remains on
earth that I like so well as a little society? I wrote not a line
to-day.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 9.&mdash;I finished the arrangement of the letters so as to put them
into Mr. Gordon's hands. It will be a great job done. But, in the
meanwhile, it interrupts my work sadly, for I kept busy till one o'clock
to-day with this idle man's labour. Still, however, it might have been
long enough ere I got a confidential person like Gordon to arrange these
confidential papers. They are all in his hands now. Walked after one.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 10.&mdash;This is a morning of fidgety, nervous confusion. I sought
successively my box of Bramah pens, my proof-sheets, and last, not least
anxiously, my spectacles. I am convinced I lost a full hour in these
various chases. I collected all my insubordinate movables at once, but
had scarce corrected the proof and written half-a-score of lines, than
enter Dalgleish, declaring the Blucher hour is come. The weather,
however, is rainy, and fitted for a day of pure work, but I was able
only to finish my task of three pages.</p>

<p>The death of the Premier is announced. Late George Canning, the witty,
the accomplished, the ambitious; he <a name="Page_20"></a>who had toiled thirty years, and
involved himself in the most harassing discussions to attain this dizzy
height; he who had held it for three months of intrigue and obloquy&mdash;and
now a heap of dust, and that is all. He was an early and familiar friend
of mine, through my intimacy with George Ellis. No man possessed a gayer
and more playful wit in society; no one, since Pitt's time, had more
commanding sarcasm in debate; in the House of Commons he was the terror
of that species of orators called the Yelpers. His lash fetched away
both skin and flesh, and would have penetrated the hide of a rhinoceros.
In his conduct as a statesman he had a great fault: he lent himself too
willingly to intrigue. Thus he got into his quarrel with Lord
Castlereagh,<a name="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> and lost credit with the country for want of openness.
Thus too, he got involved with the Queen's party to such an extent that
it fettered him upon that memorable quarrel, and obliged him to butter
Sir Robert Wilson with dear friend, and gallant general, and so forth.
The last composition with the Whigs was a sacrifice of principle on both
sides. I have some reason to think they counted on getting rid of him in
two or three years. To me Canning was always personally most kind. I
saw, with pain, a great change in his health when I met him at Colonel
Bolton's at Stors in 1825. In London I thought him looking better.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 11.&mdash;Wrote nearly five pages; then walked. A visit from Henry
Scott;<a name="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> nothing known as yet about politics. A high Tory
Administration would be a great evil at this time. There are repairs in
the structure of our constitution which ought to be made at this season,
and without which the people will not long be silent. A pure Whig
Administration would probably play the devil by attempting a thorough
repair. As to a compound, or melo-dramatic, Ministry, the parts out of
which such a one could be or<a name="Page_21"></a>ganised just now are at a terrible discount
in public estimation, nor will they be at par in a hurry again. The
public were generally shocked at the complete lack of principle
testified by public men on the late occasion, and by some who till then
had some credit with the public. The Duke of W. has risen by his
firmness on the one side, Earl Grey on the other.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 12.&mdash;Wrote my task and no more. Walked with Lockhart from one
o'clock to four. Took in our way the Glen, which looks beautiful. I
walked with extreme pain and feebleness until we began to turn
homewards, when the relaxation of the ankle sinews seemed to be removed,
and I trode merrily home. This is strange; that exercise should restore
the nerves from the chill or numbness which is allied to palsy, I am
well aware, but how it should restore elasticity to sinews that are too
much relaxed, I for one cannot comprehend. Colonel Russell came to
dinner with us, and to consult me about some family matters. He has the
spirit of a gentleman; that is certain.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 13.&mdash;A letter from booksellers at Brussels informs me of the
pleasant tidings that <i>Napoleon</i> is a total failure; that they have lost
much money on a version which they were at great expense in preparing,
and modestly propose that I should write a novel to make them amends for
loss on a speculation which I knew nothing about. &quot;Have you nothing else
to ask?&quot; as Sancho says to the farmer, who asks him to stock a farm for
his son, portion off his daughters, etc. etc. They state themselves to
be young booksellers; certes, they must hold me to be a <i>very</i> young
author! Napoleon, however, has failed on the Continent&mdash;and perhaps in
England also; for, from the mumbling, half-grumbling tone of Longman and
Co., dissatisfaction may be apprehended. Well, I can set my face to it
boldly. I live not in the public opinion, not I; but egad! I live <i>by</i>
it, and that is worse. <i>Tu ne cede malis, sed contra</i>, etc.</p><a name="Page_22"></a>

<p>I corrected and transmitted sheets before breakfast; afterwards went and
cut wood with Tom, but returned about twelve in rather a melancholy
humour. I fear this failure may be followed by others; and then what
chance of extricating my affairs. But they that look to freits, freits
will follow them. <i>Hussards en avant</i>,&mdash;care killed a cat. I finished
three pages&mdash;that is, a full task of the <i>Chronicles</i>&mdash;after I returned.
Mr. and Mrs. Philips of Manchester came to dinner.</p>

<p><i>August 14.</i>&mdash;Finished my task before breakfast. A bad rainy day, for
which I should not have cared but for my guests. However, being
good-humoured persons and gifted with taste, we got on very well, by
dint of showing prints, curiosities; finally the house up stairs and
down; and at length by undertaking a pilgrimage to Melrose in the rain,
which pilgrimage we accomplished, but never entered the Abbey Church,
having just had wetting enough to induce us, when we arrived at the
gate, to &quot;Turn again, Whittington.&quot;</p>

<p><i>August</i> 15.&mdash;Wrote in the morning. After breakfast walked with Mr.
Philips, who is about to build and plan himself, and therefore seemed to
enter <i>con amore</i> into all I had been doing, asked questions, and seemed
really interested to learn what I thought myself not ill-qualified to
teach. The little feeling of superior information in such cases is
extremely agreeable. On the contrary, it is a great scrape to find you
have been boring some one who did not care a d&mdash;&mdash; about the matter, so
to speak; and that you might have been as well employed in buttering a
whin-stone. Mr. and Mrs. Philips left us about twelve&mdash;day bad. I wrote
nearly five pages of <i>Chronicles</i>.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 16.&mdash;A wet, disagreeable, sulky day, but such things may be
carried to account. I wrote upwards of seven pages, and placed myself
<i>rectus in curia</i> with Madam Duty, who was beginning to lift up her
throat against me. Nothing remarkable except that Huntly Gordon left
us.</p><a name="Page_23"></a>

<p><i>August 17.</i>&mdash;Wrote my task in the morning. After breakfast went out and
cut wood with Tom and John Swanston, and hewed away with my own hand;
remained on foot from eleven o'clock till past three, doing, in my
opinion, a great deal of good in plantations above the house, where the
firs had been permitted to predominate too much over the oak and
hardwood. The day was rough and stormy&mdash;not the worst for working, and I
could do it with a good conscience, all being well forward in the duty
line. After tea I worked a little longer. On the whole finished four
leaves and upwards&mdash;about a printed sheet&mdash;which is enough for one day.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 18.&mdash;Finished about five leaves, and then out to the wood,
where I chopped away among the trees, laying the foundation for future
scenery. These woods will one day occupy a great number of hands. Four
years hence they will employ ten stout woodsmen almost every day of the
year. Henry and William Scott (Harden) came to dinner.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 19.&mdash;Wrote till about one, then walked for an hour or two by
myself entirely; finished five pages before dinner, when we had Captain
and Mrs. Hamilton and young Davidoff, who is their guest. They remained
with us all night.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 20.&mdash;I corrected proofs and wrote one leaf before breakfast;
then went up to Selkirk to try a fellow for an assault. The people there
get rather riotous. This is a turbulent fierce fellow. Some of his
attitudes were good during the trial. This dissipated my attention for
the day, although I was back by half-past two. I did not work any more,
so am behind in my reckoning.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 21.&mdash;Wrote four pages, then set out to make a call at
Sunderland Hall and Yair, but the old sociable broke down before we had
got past the thicket, so we trudged all back on foot, and I wrote
another page. This makes up the deficiency of yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="Page_24"></a><i>August</i> 22.&mdash;I wrote four or five leaves, but begin to get aground for
want of Indian localities. Colonel Ferguson's absence is unlucky, and
half-a-dozen Qui Hi's besides, willing to write chits,<a name="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> eat tiffin,
and vent all their Pagan jargon when one does not want to hear it; and
now that I want a touch of their slang, lo! there is not one near me.
Mr. Adolphus, son of the celebrated counsel, and author of a work on the
<i>Waverley Novels</i>,<a name="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> came to make me a visit. He is a modest as well
as an able man, and I am obliged to him for the delicacy with which he
treated a matter in which I was personally so much concerned. Mr. and
Mrs. Hamilton asked us to breakfast to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 23.&mdash;Went to breakfast at Chiefswood, which, with a circuitous
walk, have consumed the day. Found, in the first place, my friend Allan,
the painter, busy about a picture, into which he intends introducing
living characters&mdash;a kind of revel at Abbotsford. Second, a whimsical
party, consisting of John Stevenson, the bookseller, Peter Buchan from
Peterhead, a quiz of a poetical creature, and a bookbinder, a friend of
theirs. The plan was to consult me about publishing a great quantity of
ballads which this Mr. Buchan has collected. I glanced them over. He has
been very successful, for they are obviously genuine, and many of them
very curious. Others are various editions of well-known ballads. I could
not make the man comprehend that these last were of little value, being
generally worse readings of what was already published. A small edition
published by subscription may possibly succeed. It is a great pity that
few of these ballads are historical, almost all being of the romantic
cast. They certainly ought to be preserved, after striking out one or
two which have been sophisticated, I suppose by Mr. Buchan himself,
which <a name="Page_25"></a>are easily distinguishable from the genuine ballads.<a name="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> No one
but Burns ever succeeded in patching up old Scottish songs with any good
effect.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 24.&mdash;Corrected proofs and wrote letters in the morning. Began a
review upon Monteath's Planter for Lockhart.<a name="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Other matters at a
stand. A drive down to Mertoun, and engaged to dine there on Sunday
first. This consumed the day.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 25.&mdash;Mr. Adolphus left us this morning after a very agreeable
visit. We all dined at Dr. Brewster's. Met Sir John Wright, Miss Haig,
etc. Slandered our neighbours, and were good company. Major John Scott
there. I did a little more at the review to-day. But I cannot go on with
the tale without I could speak a little Hindostanee&mdash;a small seasoning
of curry-powder. Ferguson will do it if I can screw it out of him.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 26.&mdash;Encore review. Walked from twelve till three, then drove
to Mertoun with Lockhart and Allan. Dined <i>en famille</i>, and home by
half-past ten. We thought of adding a third volume to the <i>Chronicles</i>,
but Gibson is afraid it would give grounds for a pretext to seize this
work on the part of Constable's creditors, who seem determined to take
any advantage of me, but they can only show their teeth I trust; though
I wish the arbitration was ended.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 27.&mdash;Sent off proofs in morning, revised in afternoon. Walked
from one till four. What a life of uniformity! Yet I never wish to
change it. I even regret I must go to town to meet Lady Compton<a name="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> next
week.</p>

<p>A singular letter from a lady, requesting I would father a novel of
hers. That won't pass.<a name="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_26"></a>
<p>Cadell writes me, transmitting a notice from the French papers that
Gourgaud has gone, or is going, to London to verify the facts alleged in
my history of Napoleon, and the bibliopolist is in a great funk. I lack
some part of his instinct. I have done Gourgaud no wrong: every word
imputed to him exists in the papers submitted to me as historical
documents<a name="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>, and I should have been a shameful coward if I had shunned
using them. At my years it is somewhat late for an affair of honour, and
as a reasonable man I would avoid such an arbitrament, but will not
plead privilege of literature. The country shall not be disgraced in my
person, and having stated why I think I owe him no satisfaction, I will
at the same time most willingly give it to him.</p>

<p>I have written to Will Clerk to stand my friend if necessary. He has
mettle in him, and thinks of my honour as well as my safety.</p>
<a name="Page_27"></a>
<p><i>August</i> 28.&mdash;I am still bothering with the review, but gave Lockhart
fifteen leaves, which is something. Learned with regret that Williams
leaves his situation of Rector of the New Academy. It is a shot in the
wing of the institution; for he is a heaven-born teacher. Walked at two
till four along the thicket, and by the river-side, where I go seldom; I
can't say why, unless that the walk is less private than those more
distant. Lockhart, Allan, and I, talk of an excursion to Kelso
to-morrow. I have no friends there now. Yet once how many!</p>

<p><i>August</i> 29.&mdash;Went on our little expedition, breakfasting at Mertoun.
Called at Fleurs, where we found Sir John S. and his whole family. The
great lady received us well, though we had been very remiss in our duty.
From that we went to Kelso, where I saw not a soul to acknowledge former
acquaintance. How should I, when my residence there was before 1783, I
fancy?<a name="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> The little cottage in which I lived with poor Aunt Jenny is
still standing, but the great garden is divided betwixt three
proprietors. Its huge platanus tree withered, I was told, in the same
season which was fatal to so many of the species. It was cut down. The
yew-hedges, labyrinths, wildernesses, and other marks that it had once
been the abode of one of the Millers connected with the author of the
<i>Gardener's Dictionary</i> (they were a Quaker family), are all
obliterated, and the place is as common and vulgar as may be. The lady
the cottage belongs to was very civil. Allan, as a man of taste, was
much delighted with what he saw. When we returned, we found our party at
home increased by Lady Anna Maria Elliot, who had been showing Melrose
to two friends, Miss Drinkwaters. Lady M.'s wit and good-humour made the
evening go pleasantly off. There were also two friends of Charles's, by
name Paley (a nephew of the archdeacon) and Ashworth. They seem nice
young men, with modesty and good-breeding. I am glad, as my mother used
to say, that <a name="Page_28"></a>his friends are so presentable. Moreover, there came my
old, right trusty, and well-beloved friend, John Richardson, so we were
a full party. Lady Anna Maria returned in the evening. Francis Scott
also dined with us.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 30.&mdash;Disposed of my party as I best might, and worked at my
review. Walked out at one, and remained till near five. Mr. Scott of
Harden and David Thomson, W.S., dined with us. Walked with Mr. Allan
through Haxel Cleugh.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 31.&mdash;Went on with my review; but I have got Sir Henry's
original pamphlet,<a name="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> which is very cleverly written. I find I cannot
touch on his mode of transplantation at all in this article. It involves
many questions, and some of importance, so I will make another article
for January. Walked up the Rhymer's Glen with John Richardson.<a name="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_29"></a>

<a name="SEPTEMBER_1827"></a><h2>SEPTEMBER.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>September</i> 1.&mdash;Colonel Ferguson and Colonel Byers breakfasted; the
latter from India, the nephew of the old antiquarian;<a name="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> but I had not
an opportunity to speak to him about the Eastern information required
for the <i>Chronicles</i>. Besides, my review is not finished, though I
wrought hard to-day. Sir William Hamilton and his brother, Captain
Hamilton, called; also young Davidoff. I am somewhat sorry for my young
friend. His friends permit him to remain too long in Britain to be happy
in Russia. Yet this [is a] prejudice of those who suppose that when the
institutions and habits by which they are governed come to be known to
strangers, they must become exclusively attached to them. This is not
so. The Hottentot returns from civilisation to the wild manners of his
kraal, and wherefore should not a Russian resume his despotic ideas when
returned to his country?</p>

<p><i>September</i> 2.&mdash;This was a very warm day. I remained at home, chiefly
engaged in arranging papers, as I go away to-morrow. It is lucky these
starts happen from time to time as I should otherwise never get my table
clear. At five o'clock the air became cooler, and I sat out of doors and
played with the children. Anne, who had been at Mertoun the day before,
brought up Anne and Elizabeth Scott<a name="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> with her, and Francis has been
with us since yesterday. Richardson left us.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 3.&mdash;Went on with my arranging of papers till twelve, when I
took chaise and arrived at Melville Castle.</p>

<p><a name="Page_30"></a>Found Lord and Lady M. and the two young ladies. Dr. Hope, my old
school-fellow James Hope<a name="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> and his son, made up our party, which was
very pleasant. After they went away we had some private conversation
about politics. The Whigs and Tories of the Cabinet are strangely
divided, the former desiring to have Mr. Herries for Chancellor of the
Exchequer, the latter to have Lord Palmerston, that Calcraft may be
Secretary of War. The King has declared firmly for Herries, on which
Lord Goderich with <i>tears</i> entreated Herries to remove the bone of
contention by declining to accept. The King called him a blubbering
fool. That the King does not like or trust the Whigs is obvious from his
passing over Lord Lansdowne, a man who, I should suppose, is infinitely
better fitted for a Premier than Goderich. But he probably looks with no
greater [favour] on the return of the High Tories. I fear he may wish to
govern by the system of <i>bascule</i>, or balancing the two parties, a
perilous game<a name="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>. The Advocate<a name="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> also dined with us.</p>
<br />

<p><i>September 4, [Edinburgh]</i>.&mdash;Came into town after breakfast, and saw
Gibson, whose account of affairs is comfortable. Also William Clerk,
whom I found quite ready and willing to stand my friend if Gourgaud
should come my road. He agrees with me that there is no reason why he
should turn on me, but that if he does, reason or none, it is best to
stand buff to him. It is clear to me that what is least forgiven in a
man of any mark or likelihood is want of that article blackguardly
called <i>pluck</i>. All the fine qualities of genius cannot make amends for
it. We are told the genius of poets especially is irreconcilable with
this species of grenadier accomplishment<a name="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>. If so, <i>quel chien de
g&eacute;nie</i>! Saw Lady Compton. I dine with her to-day, and go to Glasgow with
her to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>September 5</i>.&mdash;Dined with Lady Compton yesterday, and <a name="Page_31"></a>talked over old
stories until nine, our <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> being a very agreeable one. Then
hence to my good friend John Gibson's, and talked with him of sundries.
I had an odd dream last night. It seemed to me that I was at a panorama,
when a vulgar little man behind me was making some very clever but
impudent remarks on the picture, and at the same time seemed desirous of
information, which no one would give him. I turned round and saw a young
fellow dressed like a common carter, with a blue coat and red waistcoat,
and a whip tied across him. He was young, with a hatchet-face, which was
turned to a brick colour by exposure to the weather, sharp eyes, and in
manner and voice not unlike John Leyden. I was so much struck with his
countenance and talents that I asked him about his situation, and
expressed a wish to mend it. He followed me, from the hopes which I
excited, and we had a dreadful walk among ruins, and afterwards I found
myself on horseback, and in front of a roaring torrent. I plunged in as
I have formerly done in good sad earnest, and got to the other side.
Then I got home among my children and grandchildren, and there also was
my genius. Now this would defy Daniel and the soothsayers to boot; nor
do I know why I should now put it down, except that I have seldom seen a
portrait in life which was more strongly marked on my memory than that
man's. Perhaps my genius was Mr. Dickinson, papermaker, who has
undertaken that the London creditors who hold Constable's bills will be
satisfied with 10s. in the pound. This would be turning a genius to
purpose, for 6s. 8d. is provided, and they can have no difficulty about
3s. 4d. These debts, for which I am legally responsible, though no party
to their contraction, amount to &pound;30,000 odds. Now if they can be cleared
for &pound;15,000 it is just so much gained. This would be a giant step to
freedom. I see in my present comfortable quarters<a name="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> some of my <a name="Page_32"></a>own
old furniture in Castle St., which gives me rather queer feelings. I
remember poor Charlotte and I having so much thought about buying these
things. Well, they are in kind and friendly hands.</p>

<p><i>September 6</i>.&mdash;Went with Lady Compton to Glasgow, and had as pleasant a
journey as the kindness, wit, and accomplishment of my companion could
make it. Lady C. gives an admirable account of Rome, and the various
strange characters she has met in foreign parts. I was much taken with
some stories out of a romance called <i>Manuscrit trouv&eacute; &agrave; Saragosse</i>, by
a certain Count John Polowsky [Potocki?], a Pole. It seems betwixt the
style of Cazotti, Count Hamilton and Le Sage. The Count was a toiler
after supernatural secrets, an adept, and understood the cabbala. He put
himself to death, with many odd circumstances, inferring derangement. I
am to get a sight of the book if it be possible. At Glasgow (Buck's
Head) we met Mrs. Maclean Clephane and her two daughters, and there was
much joy. After the dinner the ladies sung, particularly Anna Jane, who
has more taste and talent of every kind than half the people going with
great reputations on their backs.</p>

<p>A very pleasant day was paid for by a restless night.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 7.&mdash;This day had calls from Lord Provost and Mr. Rutherford
(William) with invitations, which I declined. Read in manuscript a very
clever play (comedy) by Miss A.J. Clephane in the old style, which was
very happily imitated. The plot was confused&mdash;too much taking and
retaking of prisoners, but the dialogue was excellent.</p>

<p>Took leave of these dear friends, never perhaps to meet all together
again, for two of us are old. Went down by steam to Colonel Campbell's,
Blythswood House, where I was most courteously received by him and his
sisters. We are kinsfolk and very old acquaintance. His seat here is a
fine one; the house is both grand and comfortable.</p>

<p>We walked to Lawrence Lockhart's of Inchinnan, within <a name="Page_33"></a>a mile of
Blythswood House. It is extremely nice and comfortable, far beyond the
style of a Scotch clergyman; but Lawrence is wealthy. I found John
Lockhart and Sophia there, returned from Largs. We all dined at Colonel
Campbell's on turtle, and all manner of good things. Miss A. and H.
Walker were there. The sleep at night made amends for the Buck's Head.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 8.&mdash;Colonel Campbell carried me to breakfast in Glasgow, and
at ten I took chaise for Corehouse, where I found my old friend George
Cranstoun rejoiced to see me, and glad when I told him what Lord Newton
had determined in my affairs. I should observe I saw the banks of the
Clyde above Hamilton much denuded of its copse, <i>untimely cut</i>; and the
stools ill cut, and worse kept. Cranstoun and I walked before dinner. I
never saw the great fall of Corehouse from this side before, and I think
it the best point, perhaps; at all events, it is not that from which it
is usually seen; so Lord Corehouse has the sight and escapes the
tourists. Dined with him, his sister Mrs. Cunningham, and Corehouse.</p>

<p>I omitted to mention in yesterday's note that within Blythswood
plantation, near to the Bridge of Inchinnan, the unfortunate Earl of
Argyle was taken in 1685, at a stone called Argyle's Stone. Blythswood
says the Highland drovers break down his fences in order to pay a visit
to the place. The Earl had passed the Cart river, and was taken on the
Renfrew side.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 9.&mdash;This is a superb place of Corehouse's. Cranstoun has as
much feeling about improvement as other things. Like all new improvers,
he is at more expense than is necessary, plants too thick, and trenches
where trenching is superfluous. But this is the eagerness of a young
artist. Besides the grand lion, the Fall of Clyde, he has more than one
lion's whelp; a fall of a brook in a cleugh called Mill's Gill must be
superb in rainy weather. The old<a name="Page_34"></a> Castle of Corehouse is much more
castle-like on this than from the other side.</p>

<p>Left Corehouse at eight in the morning, and reached Lanark by half-past
nine. I was thus long in travelling three miles because the postilion
chose to suppose I was bound for Biggar, and was two miles ere I
discovered what he was doing. I thought he aimed at crossing the Clyde
by some new bridge above Bonnington. Breakfasted at Lanark with the
Lockharts, and reached Abbotsford this evening by nine o'clock.</p>

<p>Thus ends a pleasant expedition among the people I like most. Drawback
only one. It has cost me &pound;15, including two gowns for Sophia and Anne;
and I have lost six days' labour. Both may be soon made up.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;We lunched (dined, <i>videlicet</i>) with Professor Wilson at
Inverleithen, and met James Hogg,<a name="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>September 10, [Abbotsford]</i>.&mdash;Gourgaud's wrath has burst forth in a
very distant clap of thunder, in which he accuses me of combining with
the ministry to slander his rag of a reputation. He be d&mdash;&mdash;d for a
fool, to make his case worse <a name="Page_35"></a>by stirring. I shall only revenge myself
by publishing the whole extracts I made from the records of the Colonial
Office, in which he will find enough to make him bite his nails. Still I
wonder he did not come over and try his manhood otherwise. I would not
have shunned him nor any Frenchman who ever kissed Bonaparte's breech.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 11.&mdash;Went to Huntly Burn and breakfasted with Colonel
Ferguson, who has promised to have some Indian memoranda ready for me.
After breakfast went to choose the ground for a new plantation, to be
added next week to the end of Jane's Wood. Came to dinner Lord Carnarvon
and his son and daughter; also Lord Francis Leveson Gower, the
translator of <i>Faust</i>.</p>
<br />

<p><i>September</i> 12.&mdash;Walk with Lord Francis. When we return, behold ye!
enter Lady Hampden and Lady Wedderburn. In the days of George Square,
Jane and Maria Brown<a name="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>, beauties and toasts. There was much pleasure
on my side, and some, I suppose, on theirs; and there was a riding, and
a running, and a chattering, and an asking, and a showing&mdash;a real scene
of confusion, yet mirth and good spirits. Our guests quit us next day.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 13.&mdash;Fined a man for an assault at Selkirk. He pleaded
guilty, which made short work. The beggarly appearance of the Jury in
the new system is very worthy of note. One was a menial servant. When I
returned, James Ballantyne and Mr. Cadell arrived. They bring a good
account of matters in general. Cadell explained to me a plan for
securing the copyright of the novels, which has a very good face. It
appears they are going off fast; and if the glut of the market is once
reduced by sales, the property will be excellent, and may be increased
by notes. James B. brought his son. Robert Rutherford also here, and
Miss Russells.</p>

<p><a name="Page_36"></a><i>September</i> 14.&mdash;In the morning wrote my answer to Gourgaud, rather too
keen perhaps, but I owe him nothing; and as for exciting his resentment,
I will neither seek nor avoid it.</p>

<p>Cadell's views seem fair, and he is open and explicit. His brothers
support him, and he has no want of cash. He sells two or three copies of
Bonaparte and one of the novels, or two, almost every day. He must soon,
he says, apply to London for copies. Read a Refutation, as it calls
itself, of Napoleon's history. It is so very polite and accommodating
that every third word is a concession&mdash;the work of a man able to judge
distinctly on specific facts, but erroneous in his general results. He
will say the same of me, perhaps. Ballantyne and Cadell leave us. Enter
Miss Sinclairs, two in number, also a translator, and a little Flemish
woman, his wife&mdash;very good-humoured, rather a little given to
compliment; name Fauconpret. They are to return at night in a gig as far
as Kelso&mdash;a bold undertaking.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 16.&mdash;The ladies went to Church; I, God forgive me, finished
the <i>Chronicles</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> with a good deal of assistance from Colonel
Ferguson's notes about Indian affairs. The patch is, I suspect, too
glaring to be pleasing; but the Colonel's sketches are capitally good. I
understand, too, there are one or two East Indian novels which have
lately appeared. Naboclish! <i>vogue la gal&egrave;re</i>!</p>

<p><i>September</i> 17.&mdash;Received from James B. the proofs of my reply to
General Gourgaud, with some cautious balaam from mine honest friend,
alarmed by a Highland Colonel, who had described Gourgaud as a <i>mauvais
gar&ccedil;on</i>, famous fencer, marksman, and so forth. I wrote in answer, which
is true, that I would hope all my friends would trust to my acting with
proper caution and advice; but that if I were capable, in a moment of
weakness, of doing anything short <a name="Page_37"></a>of what my honour demanded, I would
die the death of a poisoned rat in hole, out of mere sense of my own
degradation. God knows, that, though life is placid enough with me, I do
not feel anything to attach me to it so strongly as to occasion my
avoiding any risk which duty to my character may demand from me.</p>

<p>I set to work with the <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>, second volume, and
finished four pages.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 18.&mdash;Wrote five pages of the <i>Tales</i>. Walked from Huntly
Burn, having gone in the carriage. Smoked my cigar with Lockhart after
dinner, and then whiled away the evening over one of Miss Austen's
novels. There is a truth of painting in her writings which always
delights me. They do not, it is true, get above the middle classes of
society, but there she is inimitable.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 19.&mdash;Wrote three pages, but dawdled a good deal; yet the
<i>Tales</i> get on, although I feel bilious, and vapourish, I believe I must
call it. At such times my loneliness, and the increasing inability to
walk, come dark over me, but surely these mulligrubs belong to the mind
more than the body.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 22.&mdash;Captain and Colonel Ferguson, the last returned from
Ireland, dined here. Prayer of the minister of the Cumbrays, two
miserable islands in the mouth of the Clyde: &quot;O Lord, bless and be
gracious to the Greater and the Lesser Cumbrays, and in thy mercy do not
forget the adjacent islands of Great Britain and Ireland.&quot;</p>

<p><i>September</i> 23.&mdash;Worked in the morning; then drove over to Huntly Burn,
chiefly to get from the good-humoured Colonel the accurate spelling of
certain Hindu words which I have been using under his instructions. By
the way, the sketches he gave me of Indian manners are highly
picturesque. I have made up my Journal, which was three days in arrear.
Also I wrought a little, so that the second volume of <i>Grandfather's
Tales</i> is nearly half finished.</p>

<p><a name="Page_38"></a><i>September</i> 24.&mdash;Worked in the morning as usual, and sent off the
proofs and copy. Something of the black dog still hanging about me; but
I will shake him off. I generally affect good spirits in company of my
family, whether I am enjoying them or not. It is too severe to sadden
the harmless mirth of others by suffering your own causeless melancholy
to be seen; and this species of exertion is, like virtue, its own
reward; for the good spirits, which are at first simulated, become at
length real.<a name="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>September 25, [Edinburgh]</i>,&mdash;Got into town by one o'clock, the purpose
being to give my deposition before Lord Newton in a case betwixt me and
Constable's creditors. My oath seemed satisfactory; but new reasons were
alleged for additional discussion, which is, I trust, to end this
wearisome matter. I dined with Mr. Gibson, and slept there. J.B. dined
with us, and we had thoughts how to save our copyright by a bargain with
Cadell. I hope it will turn to good, as I could add notes to a future
edition, and give them some value.</p>

<p><i>September 26, [Abbotsford]</i>.&mdash;Set off in mail coach, and my horses met
me at Yair Bridge. I travelled with rather a pleasant man, an agent, I
found, on Lord Seaford's<a name="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> West Indian Estates. Got home by twelve
o'clock, and might have been here earlier if the Tweed had not been too
large for fording. I must note down my cash lest it gets out of my head;
&quot;may the foul fa' the gear, and the blathrie o't,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> and yet there's
no doing either with it or without it.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 27.&mdash;The morning was damp, dripping, and unpleasant; so I
even made a work of necessity, and set to the <i>Tales</i> like a dragon. I
murdered M'Lellan of Bomby at Thrieve Castle; stabbed the Black Douglas
in the town of Stirling; astonished King James before Roxburgh; and
<a name="Page_39"></a>stifled the Earl of Mar in his bath in the Canongate. A wild world, my
masters, this Scotland of ours must have been. No fear of want of
interest; no lassitude in those days for want of work,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;For treason, d' ye see,<br /></span>
<span>Was to them a dish of tea,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And murther bread and butter.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We dined at Gattonside with Mr. Bainbridge, who kindly presented me with
six bottles of super-excellent Jamaica rum, and with a manuscript
collection of poetry, said to be Swift's handwriting, which it
resembles. It is, I think, poor Stella's. Nothing very new in it.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 28.&mdash;Another dropping and busy day. I wrought hard at the
<i>Historical Tales</i>, which get on fast.</p>
<br />

<p><i>September</i> 29.&mdash;I went on with the little history which now (<i>i.e.</i>
vol. ii.) doth appropinque an end. Received in the evening [Nos. 37 to
41?] of the Roxburghe publications. They are very curious, and,
generally speaking, well selected. The following struck me:&mdash;An Italian
poem on the subject of Floddenfield; the legend of St. Robert of
Knaresborough; two plays, printed from MS. by Mr. Haslewood. It does not
appear that Mr. H. fully appreciated the light which he was throwing on
the theatrical history by this valuable communication. It appears that
the change of place, or of scene as we term it, was intimated in the
following manner.</p>

<p>In the middle of the stage was placed Colchester, and the sign of
Pigot's tavern&mdash;called the Tarlton&mdash;intimated what part of the town was
represented. The name was painted above. On one side of the stage was,
in like manner, painted a town, which the name announced to be Maldon;
on the other side a ranger's lodge. The scene lay through the piece in
one or other of these three places, and the entrance of the characters
determined where each scene lay. If they came in from Colchester, then
Colchester was for the time the scene of action. When that scene was
<a name="Page_40"></a>shifted to Maldon, it was intimated by the approach of the actors from
the side where it was painted&mdash;a clumsy contrivance, doubtless, compared
to changeable scenery; yet sufficient to impress the audience with a
sense of what was meant.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 30.&mdash;Wet, drizzling, dismal day. I finished odds and ends,
scarce stirring out of my room, yet doing little to the purpose. Wrote
to Sir Henry [Seton Steuart] about his queries concerning transplanted
trees, and to Mr. Freeling concerning the Roxburghe Club books. I have
settled to print the manuscript concerning the murder of the two Shaws
by the Master of Sinclair. I dallied with the precious time rather than
used it. Read the two Roxburghe plays; they are by William Percy, a son
of the eighth Earl of Northumberland; worthless and very gross, but
abounding with matter concerning scenery, and so forth, highly
interesting to the dramatic antiquary.</p>

<blockquote><p>NOTE <i>on the &quot;grenadier accomplishment&quot; mentioned in</i> p. 30.</p>

<p>     In a letter to the Duke of Buccleuch, of May 1818, Scott gives the
     following amusing account of an incident in the life of the Ettrick
     Shepherd:&mdash;</p>

<p>     &quot;Our poor friend Hogg has had an <i>affair of honour</i>.... Two
     mornings ago, about seven in the morning, my servant announced,
     while I was shaving in my dressing-room, that Mr. Hogg wished
     earnestly to speak with me. He was ushered in, and I cannot
     describe the half-startled, half-humorous air with which he said,
     scratching his head most vehemently, 'Odd, Scott, here's twae
     fo'k's come frae Glasgow to provoke mey to fecht a duel.' 'A duel,'
     answered I, in great astonishment, 'and what do you intend to do?'
     'Odd, I just locket them up in my room and sent the lassie for twae
     o' the police, and just gie'd the men ower to their chairge, and I
     thocht I wad come and ask you what I should do....' He had already
     settled for himself the question whether he was to fight or not,
     and all that he had to do was to go to the Police Office and tell
     the charge he had to bring against the two Glasgow gentlemen....
     The Glaswegians were greatly too many for him [in Court].... They
     returned in all triumph and glory, and Hogg took the wings of the
     morning and fled to his cottage at Altrive, not deeming himself
     altogether safe in the streets of Edinburgh! Now, although I do not
     hold valour to be an essential article in the composition of a man
     like Hogg, yet I heartily wish he could have prevailed on himself
     to swagger a little.... But considering his failure in the field
     and the Sheriff Office, I am afraid we must apply to Hogg the
     apology which is made for Waller by his biographer: 'Let us not
     condemn him with untempered severity because he was not such a
     prodigy as the world has seldom seen&mdash;because his character
     included not the poet, the orator, and the hero.'&quot;</p></blockquote>

<a name="OCTOBER_1827"></a><h2><a name="Page_41"></a>OCTOBER.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>October</i> 1.&mdash;I set about work for two hours, and finished three pages;
then walked for two hours; then home, adjusted sheriff processes, and
cleared the table. I am to set off to-morrow for Ravensworth Castle, to
meet the Duke of Wellington;<a name="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> a great let off, I suppose. Yet I would
almost rather stay and see two days more of Lockhart and my daughter,
who will be off before my return. Perhaps. But there is no end to
perhaps. We must cut the rope and let the vessel drive down the tide of
destiny.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 2.&mdash;Set out in the morning at seven, and reached Kelso by a
little past ten with my own horses. Then took the Wellington coach to
carry me to Wellington&mdash;smart that. Nobody inside but an old lady, who
proved a toy-woman in Edinburgh; her head furnished with as substantial
ware as her shop, but a good soul, I'se warrant her. Heard all her
debates with her landlord about a new door to the cellar, etc. etc.;
propriety of paying rent on the 15th or 25th of <a name="Page_42"></a>May. Landlords and
tenants have different opinions on that subject. Danger of dirty sheets
in inns. We dined at Wooler, and I found out Dr. Douglas on the outside,
son of my old acquaintance Dr. James Douglas of Kelso. This made us even
lighter in mind till we came to Whittingham. Thence to Newcastle, where
an obstreperous horse retarded us for an hour at least, to the great
alarm of my friend the toy-woman. <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;She would have made a good
feather-bed if the carriage had happened to fall, and her undermost. The
heavy roads had retarded us near an hour more, so that I hesitated to go
to Ravensworth so late; but my good woman's tales of dirty sheets, and
certain recollections of a Newcastle inn, induced me to go on. When I
arrived the family had just retired. Lord Ravensworth and Mr. Liddell
came down, however, and really received me as kindly as possible.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 3.&mdash;Rose about eight or later. My morals begin to be corrupted
by travelling and fine company. Went to Durham with Lord Ravensworth
betwixt one and two. Found the gentlemen of Durham county and town
assembled to receive the Duke of Wellington. I saw several old friends,
and with difficulty suited names to faces, and faces to names. There was
Headlam, Dr. Gilly and his wife, and a world of acquaintance besides,
Sir Thomas Lawrence too, with Lord Londonderry. I asked him to come on
with me, but he could not. He is, from habit of coaxing his subjects I
suppose, a little too fair-spoken, otherwise very pleasant. The Duke
arrived very late. There were bells and cannon and drums, trumpets and
banners, besides a fine troop of yeomanry. The address was well
expressed, and as well answered by the Duke. The enthusiasm of the
ladies and the gentry was great&mdash;the common people were lukewarm<a name="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>.
The Duke has lost popularity in accepting political power. He will <a name="Page_43"></a>be
more useful to his country it may be than ever, but will scarce be so
gracious in the people's eyes; and he will not care a curse for what
outward show he has lost. But I must not talk of curses, for we are
going to take our dinner with the Bishop of Durham<a name="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>, a man of amiable
and courteous manners, who becomes his station well, but has traces of
bad health on his countenance.</p>

<p>We dined, about one hundred and forty or fifty men, a distinguished
company for rank and property. Marshal Beresford, and Sir John<a name="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>,
amongst others, Marquis of Lothian, Lord Duncombe, Marquis Londonderry,
and I know not who besides:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Lords and Dukes and noble Princes,<br /></span>
<span>All the pride and flower of Spain.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We dined in the rude old baronial hall, impressive from its antiquity,
and fortunately free from the plaster of former improvement, as I trust
it will, from the gingerbread taste of modern Gothicisers. The bright
moon streaming in through the old Gothic windows, made a light which
contrasted strangely with the artificial lights within; spears, banners,
and armour were intermixed with the pictures of old, and the whole had a
singular mixture of baronial pomp with the graver and more chastened
dignity of prelacy. The conduct of our reverend entertainer suited the
character remarkably well. Amid the welcome of a Count Palatine he did
not for an instant forget the gravity of the Church dignitary. All his
toasts were gracefully given, and his little speeches well made, and the
more affecting that the failing voice sometimes reminded us that our
aged host laboured under the infirmities of advanced life. To me
personally the Bishop was very civil, and paid me his public
<a name="Page_44"></a>compliments by proposing my health in the most gratifying manner.<a name="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p>The Bishop's lady received a sort of drawing-room after we rose from
table, at which a great many ladies attended. I ought not to forget that
the singers of the choir attended at dinner, and sung the Anthem <i>Non
nobis Domine</i>, as they said who understood them, very well&mdash;and, as I
think, who did not understand the music, with an unusual degree of
spirit and interest. It is odd how this can be distinguished from the
notes of fellows who use their throats with as little feeling of the
notes they utter as if they were composed of the same metal as their
bugle-horns.</p>

<p>After the drawing-room we went to the Assembly-rooms, which were crowded
with company. I saw some very pretty girls dancing merrily that
old-fashioned thing called a country-dance which Old England has now
thrown aside, as she would do her creed, if there were some foreign
frippery offered instead. We got away after midnight, a large party, and
reached Ravensworth Castle&mdash;Duke of Wellington, Lord Londonderry, and
about twenty besides&mdash;about half-past one. Soda water, and to bed by
two.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 4.&mdash;Slept till nigh ten&mdash;fatigued by our toils of yesterday,
and the unwonted late hours. Still too early for this Castle of
Indolence, for I found few of last night's party yet appearing. I had an
opportunity of some talk with the Duke. He does not consider Foy's
book<a name="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> as written <a name="Page_45"></a>by himself, but as a thing <i>got up</i> perhaps from
notes. Says he knew Foy very well in Spain. Mentioned that he was, like
other French officers, very desirous of seeing the English papers,
through which alone they could collect any idea of what was going on
without their own cantonments, for Napoleon permitted no communication
of that kind with France. The Duke, growing tired of this, at length
told Baron Tripp, whose services he chiefly used in communication with
the outposts, that he was not to give them the newspapers. &quot;What reason
shall I allege for withholding them?&quot; said Baron Tripp. &quot;None,&quot; replied
the Duke. &quot;Let them allege some reason why they want them.&quot; Foy was not
at a loss to assign a reason. He said he had considerable sums of money
in the English funds and wanted to see how Stocks fell and rose. The
excuse did not, however, go down<a name="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>. I remember Baron Tripp, a Dutch
nobleman, and a dandy of the first water, and yet with an energy in his
dandyism which made it respectable. He drove a gig as far as Dunrobin
Castle, and back again, <i>without a whip</i>. He looked after his own horse,
for he had no servant, and after all his little establishment of clothes
and necessaries, with all the accuracy of a <i>petit-ma&icirc;tre</i>. He was one
of the best-dressed men, and his horse was in equally fine condition as
if he had had a dozen of grooms. I met him at Lord Somerville's, and
liked him much. But there was something exaggerated, as appeared from
the conclusion of his life. Baron Tripp shot himself in Italy for no
assignable cause.</p>

<p>What is called great society, of which I have seen a good deal in my
day, is now amusing to me, because from age and indifference I have lost
the habit of considering myself as a part of it, and have only the
feelings of looking on as a spectator of the scene, who can neither play
his part well nor ill, instead of being one of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>;
and, <a name="Page_46"></a>careless what is thought of myself, I have full time to attend to
the motions of others.</p>

<p>Our party went to-day to Sunderland, where the Duke was brilliantly
received by an immense population, chiefly of seamen. The difficulty of
getting into the rooms was dreadful, for we chanced to march in the rear
of an immense Gibraltar gun, etc., all composed of glass, which is here
manufactured in great quantities. The disturbance created by this thing,
which by the way I never saw afterwards, occasioned an ebbing and
flowing of the crowd, which nearly took me off my legs. I have seen the
day I would have minded it little. The entertainment was handsome; about
two hundred dined, and appeared most hearty in the cause which had
convened them&mdash;some indeed so much so, that, finding themselves so far
on the way to perfect happiness, they e'en ... After the dinner-party
broke up there was a ball, numerously attended, where there was a
prodigious anxiety discovered for shaking of hands. The Duke had enough
of it, and I came in for my share; for, though as jackal to the lion, I
got some part in whatever was going. We got home about half-past two in
the morning, sufficiently tired. The Duke went to Seaham, a house of
Lord Londonderry's. After all, this Sunderland trip might have been
spared..</p>

<p><i>October 5</i>.&mdash;A quiet day at Ravensworth Castle, giggling and making
giggle among the kind and frank-hearted young people. Ravensworth Castle
is chiefly modern, excepting always two towers of great antiquity. Lord
Ravensworth manages his woods admirably well, and with good taste. His
castle is but half-built. Elections<a name="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> have come between. In the
evening, plenty of fine music, with heart as well as voice and
instrument. Much of the music was the <a name="Page_47"></a>spontaneous effusions of Mrs.
Arkwright, who had set Hohenlinden and other pieces of poetry. Her music
was of a highly-gifted character. She was the daughter of Stephen
Kemble. The genius she must have inherited from her mother, who was a
capital actress. The Miss Liddells and Mrs. Barrington sang the &quot;The
Campbells are coming,&quot; in a tone that might have waked the dead.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 6.&mdash;Left Ravensworth this morning, and travelled as far as
Whittingham with Marquis of Lothian. Arrived at Alnwick to dinner, where
I was very kindly received. The Duke is a handsome man,<a name="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> who will be
corpulent if he does not continue to take hard exercise. The Duchess
very pretty and lively, but her liveliness is of that kind which shows
at once it is connected with thorough principle, and is not liable to be
influenced by fashionable caprice. The habits of the family are early
and regular; I conceive they may be termed formal and old-fashioned by
such visitors as claim to be the pink of the mode. The Castle is a fine
old pile, with various courts and towers, and the entrance is
magnificent. It wants, however, the splendid feature of a keep. The
inside fitting up is an attempt at Gothic, but the taste is meagre and
poor, and done over with too much gilding. It was done half a century
ago, when this kind of taste was ill-understood. I found here the Bishop
of [Gloucester], etc. etc.</p>

<p><i>October 7</i>.&mdash;This morning went to church and heard an excellent sermon
from the Bishop of Gloucester;<a name="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> he has great dignity of manner, and
his accent and delivery were forcible. Drove out with the Duke in a
phaeton, and saw part of the park, which is a fine one, lying along the
Alne. But it has been ill-planted. It was laid out by the celebrated
Brown,<a name="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> who substituted clumps of birch and Scottish firs for <a name="Page_48"></a>the
beautiful oaks and copse which grows nowhere so freely as in
Northumberland. To complete this, the late Duke did not thin, so the
wood is in poor state. All that the Duke cuts down is so much waste, for
the people will not buy it where coals are so cheap. Had they been
oak-wood, the bark would have fetched its value; had they been grown
oaks, the sea-ports would have found a market. Had they been [larch],
the country demands for ruder purposes would have been unanswerable. The
Duke does the best he can to retrieve his woods, but seems to despond
more than a young man ought to do. It is refreshing to see a man in his
situation give so much of his time and thoughts to the improvement of
his estates, and the welfare of the people. The Duke tells me his people
in Keeldar were all quite wild the first time his father went up to
shoot there. The women had no other dress than a bed-gown and petticoat.
The men were savage and could hardly be brought to rise from the heath,
either from sullenness or fear. They sung a wild tune, the burden of
which was Ourina, ourina, ourina. The females sung, the men danced
round, and at a certain part of the tune they drew their dirks, which
they always wore.</p>

<p>We came by the remains of the old Carmelite Monastery of Hulne, which is
a very fine object in the park. It was finished by De Vesci. The gateway
of Alnwick Abbey, also a fine specimen, is standing about a mile
distant. The trees are much finer on the left side of the Alne, where
they have been let alone by the capability-villain. Visited the enceinte
of the Castle, and passed into the dungeon. There is also an armoury,
but damp, and the arms in indifferent order. One odd petard-looking
thing struck me.&mdash;<i>Mem</i>. to consult Grose. I had the honour to sit in
Hotspur's seat, and to see the Bloody Gap, where the external wall must
have been breached. The Duchess gave me a book of etchings of the
antiquities of Alnwick and Warkworth from <a name="Page_49"></a>her own drawings.<a name="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> I had
half a mind to stay to see Warkworth, but Anne is alone. We had prayers
in the evening read by the Archdeacon.<a name="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p>The Marquis of Lothian on Saturday last told me a remarkable thing,
which he had from good authority. Just before Bonaparte's return from
Elba there was much disunion at the Congress of Vienna. Russia and
Prussia, conscious of their own merits, made great demands, to which
Austria, France, and Britain, were not disposed to accede. This went so
far that war became probable, and the very Prussian army which was so
useful at Waterloo was held in readiness to attack the English. On the
other hand, England, Austria, and France entered into a private
agreement to resist, beyond a certain extent, Prussia's demands of a
barrier on the Rhine, etc., and, what is most singular of all, it was
from Bonaparte that the Emperor Alexander first heard of this triple
alliance.<a name="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> But the circumstance of finding Napoleon interesting
himself so far in the affairs of Europe alarmed the Emperor more than
the news he sent him. On the same authority, Gneisenau and most of
Bl&uuml;cher's personal suite remained behind a house at the battle of Ligny,
and sent out an officer from time to time, but did not remain even in
sight of the battle, till Bl&uuml;cher put himself at the head of the cavalry
with the zeal of an old hussar.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 8.&mdash;Left Alnwick, where I have experienced a very kind
reception, and took coach at Whittingham at eleven o'clock. I find there
is a new road to be made between Alnwick and Wooler, which will make the
communication much easier, and avoid Remside Moor.</p>

<p>Saw some fine young plantations about Whittingham suffering from
neglect, which is not the case under the <a name="Page_50"></a>Duke's own eye. He has made
two neat cottages at Percy's Cross, to preserve that ancient monument of
the fatal battle of Hedgeley Moor. The stones marking the adjacent spot
called Percy's Leap are thirty-three feet asunder. To show the
uncertainty of human testimony, I measured the distance (many years
since, it is true), and would have said and almost sworn that it was but
eighteen feet. Dined at Wooler, and reached home about seven o'clock,
having left Alnwick at half-past nine. So it would be easy to go there
to dinner from Abbotsford, starting at six in the morning, or seven
would do very well.</p>

<p><i>October 9, [Abbotsford]</i>.&mdash;No proofs here, which I think odd of Jas. B.
But I am not sorry to have a day to write letters, and besides I have a
box of books to arrange. It is a bad mizzling day, and might have been a
good day for work, yet it is not quite uselessly spent.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 10.&mdash;Breakfasted at Huntly Burn with the merry knight, Sir
Adam Ferguson. When we returned we found a whole parcel of proofs which
had been forgot yesterday at the toll&mdash;so here ends play and begins
work. Dr. Brewster and Mr. Thornhill. The latter gave me a box, made of
the real mulberry-tree.<a name="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> Very kind of him.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 11.&mdash;Being a base melancholy weeping day I e'en made the best
of it, and set in for work. Wrote ten leaves this day, equivalent to
forty pages. But then the theme was so familiar, being Scottish history,
that my pen never rested. It is more than a triple task.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 12.&mdash;Sent off proofs and copy, a full task of three pages. At
one Anne drove me to Huntly Burn, and I examined the earthen fence
intended for the new planting, and altered the line in some points. This
employed me till near four, the time of my walking home being included.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 13.&mdash;Wrote in the forenoon. Lord Bessborough and Mr. and Mrs.
Ponsonby called to see the place. His <a name="Page_51"></a>lady used to be civil to me in
London&mdash;an accomplished and pleasing woman. They only stayed an hour. At
dinner we had Lord and Lady Bathurst, and my friend Lady Georgiana&mdash;also
Marquis of Lothian and Lord Castlereagh, plenty of fine folks. Expected
also the Lord Register and Mrs. Dundas, but they could not come. Lord
Bathurst told me that Gourgaud had negotiated with the French Government
to the last moment of his leaving London, and that he had been told so
by the French Ambassador. Lord B. refused to see him, because he
understood he talked disrespectfully of Napoleon.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 14.&mdash;I read prayers to the company of yesterday, and we took a
drive round by Drygrange Bridge. Lord B. told me that the late king made
it at one time a point of conscience to read every word of every act of
parliament before giving his assent to it. There was a mixture of
principle and nonsense in this. Lord Lothian left us. I did a full task
to-day, which is much, considering I was a good deal occupied.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 15.&mdash;My noble guests departed, pleased I believe with their
visit. I have had to thank Lord Bathurst for former kindness. I respect
him too, as one who being far from rich, has on the late occasion
preferred political consistency to a love of office and its emoluments.
He seems to expect no opposition of a formal kind this next session.
What is wonderful, no young man of talents seems to spring up in the
House of Commons. I wonder what comes of all the clever lads whom we see
at college. The fruit apparently does not ripen as formerly. Lord
Castlereagh remained with us. I bestowed a little advice on him. He is a
warm-hearted young fellow, with some of the fashionable affectations of
the age about him, but with good feelings and an inclination to come
forward.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 16.&mdash;With all this racketing the work advances fast. The third
volume of the <i>Tales</i> is now half finished, <a name="Page_52"></a>and will, I think, be a
useful work. Some drizzling days have been of great use to its progress.
This visiting has made some dawdling, but not much, perhaps not more
than there ought to be for such a task.</p>

<p>I walked from Huntly Burn up the little Glen, which was in all the
melancholy beauty of autumn, the little brook brawling and bickering in
fine style over its falls and currents.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 17.&mdash;Drove down to Mertoun and brought up Elizabeth Scott to
be our guest for some days or so. Various chance guests arrived. One of
the most welcome was Captain MacKenzie of the Celtic Society and the 72d
regiment, a picture of a Highlander in his gigantic person and innocent
and generous disposition. Poor fellow, he is going to retreat to
Brittany, to make his half-pay support a wife and family. I did not dare
to ask how many. God send I may have the means of serving him.</p>

<p>He told me a Maclean story which was new to me. At the battle of
Sheriffmuir that clan was commanded by a chief called Hector. In the
action, as the chief rushed forward, he was frequently in situations of
peril. His foster-father followed him with seven sons, whom he reserved
as a body-guard, whom he threw forward into the battle as he saw his
chief pressed. The signal he gave was, &quot;Another for Hector!&quot; The youths
replied, &quot;Death for Hector!&quot; and were all successively killed. These
words make the sign and countersign at this day of the clan Gillian.<a name="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p>Young Shortreed dined with us and the two Fergusons, Sir Adam and the
Colonel. We had a pleasant evening.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 19.&mdash;Wrought out my task, and better&mdash;as I have done for these
several days past. Lady Anna Maria Elliot arrived unexpectedly to
dinner, and though she had a headache, brought her usual wit and
good-humour to enliven us.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 20.&mdash;The day being basely muggy, I had no <a name="Page_53"></a>walk, which I was
rather desirous to secure. I wrought, however; and two-thirds of the
last volume of <i>Tales of my Grandfather</i> are finished. I received a
large packet of proofs, etc., which for some reason had been delayed. We
had two of Dr. Brewster's boys to dinner&mdash;fine children; they are
spirited, promising, and very well-behaved.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 21.&mdash;Wrought till one o'clock, then walked out for two hours,
though with little comfort, the bushes being loaded with rain; but
exercise is very necessary to me, and I have no mind to die of my
arm-chair. A letter from Skene, acquainting me that the Censors of the
French press have prohibited the insertion of my answer to the man
Gourgaud. This is their freedom of the press! The fact is there is an
awkward &quot;composition&quot; between the Government and the people of France,
that the latter will endure the former so long as they will allow them
to lull themselves asleep with recollections of their past glory, and
neither the one nor the other sees that truth and honesty and freedom of
discussion are the best policy. He knows, though, there <i>is</i> an answer;
and that is all I care about.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 22.&mdash;Another vile damp drizzling day. I do not know any
morning in my life so fit for work, on which I nevertheless, while
desirous of employing it to purpose, make less progress. A hang-dog
drowsy feeling wrought against me, and I was obliged to lay down the pen
and indulge myself in a drumly sleep.</p>

<p>The Haigs of Bemerside, Captain Hamilton, Mr. Bainbridge and daughter,
with young Nicol Milne and the Fergusons, dined here. Miss Haig sings
Italian music better than any person I ever heard out of the
Opera-house. But I am neither a judge nor admirer of the science. I do
not know exactly what is aimed at, and therefore cannot tell what is
attained. Had a letter from Colin Mackenzie, who has proposed himself
for the little situation in the Register House. I have written, him,
begging him to use the best interest in his own behalf, and never mind
me.</p>

<p><a name="Page_54"></a><i>October</i> 23.&mdash;Another sullen rainy day. &quot;Hazy weather, Mr. Noah,&quot; as
Punch says in the puppet-show.<a name="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> I worked slow, however, and
untowardly, and fell one leaf short of my task.</p>

<p>Went to Selkirk, and dined with the forest Club, for the first time I
have been there this season. It was the collar-day, but being extremely
rainy, I did not go to see them course. <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Of all things, the
greatest bore is to hear a dull and bashful man sing a facetious song.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 24.&mdash;Vilely low in spirits. I have written a page and a half,
and doubt whether I can write more to-day. A thick throbbing at my
heart, and fancies thronging on me. A disposition to sleep, or to think
on things melancholy and horrible while I wake. Strange that one's
nerves should thus master them, for nervous the case is, as I know too
well. I am beginning to tire of my Journal, and no wonder, faith, if I
have only such trash as this to record. But the best is, a little
exertion or a change of the current of thought relieves me.</p>

<p>God, who subjects us to these strange maladies, whether of mind or body
I cannot say, has placed the power within our own reach, and we should
be grateful. I wrestled myself so far out of the Slough of Despond as to
take a good long walk, and my mind is restored to its elasticity. I did
not attempt to work, especially as we were going down to Mertoun, and
set off at five o'clock.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 25.&mdash;We arrived at Mertoun yesterday, and heard with some
surprise that George had gone up in an air balloon, and ascended two
miles and a half above this sublunary earth. I should like to have an
account of his sensations, but his letters said nothing serious about
them. Honest George, I certainly did not suspect him of being so
flighty! I visited the new plantations on the river-side with Mrs.
Scott; I wish her lord and master had some of her taste <a name="Page_55"></a>for planting.
When I came home I walked through the Rhymer's Glen, and I thought how
the little fall would look if it were heightened. When I came home a
surprise amounting nearly to a shock reached me in another letter from
L.J.S.<a name="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> Methinks this explains the gloom which hung about me
yesterday. I own that the recurrence to these matters seems like a
summons from the grave. It fascinates me. I ought perhaps to have
stopped it at once, but I have not nerve to do so. Alas! alas!&mdash;But why
alas? <i>Humana perpessi sumus</i>.</p>

<p><i>October 26.</i>&mdash;Sent off copy to Ballantyne. Drove over to Huntly Burn at
breakfast, and walked up to the dike they are building for the new
plantation. Returned home. The Fergusons dined; and we had the kirn
Supper.<a name="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> I never saw a set of finer lads and lasses, and blithely did
they ply their heels till five in the morning. It did me good to see
them, poor things.</p>

<p><i>October 27.</i>&mdash;This morning went again to Huntly Burn <a name="Page_56"></a>to breakfast.
There picked up Sir Adam and the Colonel, and drove down to old Melrose
to see the hounds cast off upon the Gateheugh, the high rocky
amphitheatre which encloses the peninsula of old Melrose, the Tweed
pouring its dark and powerful current between them. The galloping of the
riders and hallooing of the huntsmen, the cry of the hounds and the
sight of sly Reynard stealing away through the brakes, waked something
of the old spirit within me&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Even in our ashes glow their wonted fires.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On return home I had despatches of consequence. John Gibson writes that
Lord Newton has decided most of the grand questions in our favour. Good,
that! Rev. Mr. Turner writes that he is desirous, by Lord Londonderry's
consent, to place in my hands a quantity of original papers concerning
the public services of the late Lord Londonderry, with a view to drawing
up a memoir of his life. Now this task they desire to transfer to me. It
is highly complimentary; and there is this of temptation in it, that I
should be able to do justice to that ill-requited statesman in those
material points which demand the eternal gratitude of his country. But
then for me to take this matter up would lead me too much into the
hackneyed politics of the House of Commons, which <i>odi et arceo</i>.
Besides, I would have to study the Irish question, and I detest study.
<i>Item</i>.&mdash;I might arrive at conclusions different from those of my Lord
of Londonderry, and I have a taste for expressing that which I think.
Fourthly, I think it is sinking myself into a party writer. Moreover, I
should not know what to say to the disputes with Canning; and, to
conclude, I think my Lord Londonderry, if he desired such a thing at my
hands, ought to have written to me. For all which reasons, good, bad,
and indifferent, I will write declining the undertaking.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 28.&mdash;Wrote several letters, and one to Mr. Turner, declining
the task of Lord Castlereagh's Memoirs,<a name="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> with due <a name="Page_57"></a>acknowledgments.
Had his public and European politics alone been concerned, I would have
tried the task with pleasure. I wrote out my task and something more,
corrected proofs, and made a handsome remittance of copy to the press.</p>

<p><i>October 31.</i>&mdash;Just as I was merrily cutting away among my trees,
arrives Mr. Gibson with a melancholy look, and indeed the news he
brought was shocking enough. It seems Mr. Abud, the same Jew broker who
formerly was disposed to disturb me in London, has given the most
positive orders to take out diligence against me for his debt of &pound;1500.
This breaks all the measures we had resolved on, and prevents the
dividend from taking place, by which many poor persons will be great
sufferers. For me the alternative will be more painful to my feelings
than prejudicial to my interest. To take out a sequestration and allow
the persons to take what they can get will be the inevitable
consequence. This will cut short my labour by several years, which I
might spend and spend in vain in labouring to meet their demands. No
doubt they may in the interim sell the liferent of this place, with the
books and furniture. But, perhaps, it may be possible to achieve some
composition which may save these articles, as I would make many
sacrifices for that purpose. Gibson strongly advises taking a
sequestration at all events. But if the creditors choose to let Mr. Abud
have his pound of flesh out of the first cut, my mind will not be
satisfied with the plan of deranging, for the pleasure of disappointing
him, a plan of payment to which all the others had consented. We will
know more on Saturday, and not sooner. I went to Bowhill with Sir Adam
Ferguson to dinner, and maintained as good a countenance in the midst of
my perplexities as a man need desire. It is not bravado; I literally
feel myself firm and resolute.</p>





<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="NOVEMBER_1827"></a><h2><a name="Page_58"></a>NOVEMBER</h2>
<br />

<p><i>November</i> 1.&mdash;I waked in the night and lay two hours in feverish
meditation. This is a tribute to natural feeling. But the air of a fine
frosty morning gave me some elasticity of spirit. It is strange that
about a week ago I was more dispirited for nothing at all than I am now
for perplexities which set at defiance my conjectures concerning their
issue. I suppose that I, the Chronicler of the Canongate, will have to
take up my residence in the Sanctuary<a name="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> for a week or so, unless I
prefer the more airy residence of the Calton Jail, or a trip to the Isle
of Man. These furnish a pleasing choice of expedients. It is to no
purpose being angry at Ehud or Ahab, or whatever name he delights in. He
is seeking his own, and thinks by these harsh measures to render his
road to it more speedy. And now I will trouble myself no more about the
matter than I can possibly help, which will be quite enough after all.
Perhaps something may turn up better for me than I now look for. Sir
Adam Ferguson left Bowhill this morning for Dumfriesshire. I returned to
Abbotsford to Anne, and told her this unpleasant news. She stood it
remarkably well, poor body.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 2.&mdash;I was a little bilious to-night&mdash;no wonder. Had sundry
letters without any power of giving my mind to answer them&mdash;one about
Gourgaud with his nonsense. I shall not trouble my head more on that
score. Well, it is <a name="Page_59"></a>a hard knock on the elbow; I knew I had a life of
labour before me, but I was resolved to work steadily; now they have
treated me like a recusant turnspit, and put in a red-hot cinder into
the wheel alongst with [me]. But of what use is philosophy&mdash;and I have
always pretended to a little of a practical character&mdash;if it cannot
teach us to do or suffer? The day is glorious, yet I have little will to
enjoy it, but sit here ruminating upon the difference and comparative
merits of the Isle of Man and of the Abbey. Small choice betwixt them.
Were a twelvemonth over, I should perhaps smile at what makes me now
very serious.</p>

<p>Smile!&mdash;No, that can never be. My present feelings cannot be recollected
with cheerfulness; but I may drop a tear of gratitude. I have finished
my <i>Tales</i><a name="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> and have now nothing literary in hand. It would be an
evil time to begin anything.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 3.&mdash;Slept ill, and lay one hour longer than usual in the
morning. I gained an hour's quiet by it, that is much. I feel a little
shaken at the result of to-day's post. Bad it must be, whatsoever be the
alternative. I am not able to go out, my poor workers wonder that I pass
them without a word. I can imagine no alternative but either <a name="Page_60"></a>retreat to
the Sanctuary or to the Isle of Man. Both shocking enough. But in
Edinburgh I am always near the scene of action, free from uncertainty
and near my poor daughter; so I think I will prefer it, and thus I rest
in unrest. But I will not let this unman me. Our hope, heavenly and
earthly, is poorly anchored, if the cable parts upon the strain. I
believe in God who can change evil into good; and I am confident that
what befalls us is always ultimately for the best. I have a letter from
Mr. Gibson, purporting the opinion of the trustees and committee of
creditors, that I should come to town, and interesting themselves warmly
in the matter. They have intimated that they will pay Mr. Abud a
composition of six shillings per pound on his debt. This is a handsome
offer, but I understand he is determined to have his pound of flesh. If
I can prevent it, he shall not take a shilling by his hard-hearted
conduct.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 4.&mdash;Put my papers in some order, and prepared for my journey.
It is in the style of the Emperors of Abyssinia who proclaim&mdash;Cut down
the Kantuffa in the four quarters of the world,&mdash;for I know not where I
am going. Yet, were it not for poor Anne's doleful looks, I would feel
firm as a piece of granite. Even the poor dogs seem to fawn on me with
anxious meaning, as if there were something going on they could not
comprehend. They probably notice the packing of the clothes, and other
symptoms of a journey.</p>

<p>Set off at twelve, firmly resolved in body and in mind. Dined at Fushie
Bridge. Ah! good Mrs. Wilson, you know not you are like to lose an old
customer.<a name="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p>But when I arrived in Edinburgh at my faithful friend, <a name="Page_61"></a>Mr. Gibson's,
lo! the scene had again changed, and a new hare is started.<a name="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p>The trustees were clearly of opinion that the matter should be probed to
the very bottom; so Cadell sets off to-morrow in quest of Robinson,
whose haunts he knows. There was much talk concerning what should be
done, how to protect my honour's person, and to postpone commencing a
defence which must make Ahab desperate, before we can ascertain that the
grounds are really tenable. This much I think I can see, that the
trustees will rather pay the debt than break off the trust and go into a
sequestration. They are clearly right for themselves, and I believe for
me also. Whether it is in human possibility that I can clear off these
obligations or not, is very doubtful. But I would rather have it written
on my monument that I died at the desk than live under the recollection
of having neglected it. My conscience is free and happy, and would be so
if I were to be lodged in the Calton Jail. Were I shirking exertion I
should lose heart, under a sense of general contempt, and so die like a
poisoned rat in a hole.</p>

<p>Dined with Gibson and John Home. His wife is a pretty lady-like woman.
Slept there at night.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 6.&mdash;I took possession of No. 6 Shandwick Place, Mrs. Jobson's
house. Mr. Cadell had taken it for me; terms &pound;100 for four months&mdash;cheap
enough, as it is a capital house. I offered &pound;5 for immediate entrance,
as I do not like to fly back to Abbotsford. So here we are established,
<i>i.e.</i> John Nicolson<a name="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> and I, with good fires and all snug.</p>

I waited on L.J.S.; an affecting meeting.<a name="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>

<p>Sir William Forbes came in before dinner to me, high-spirited noble
fellow as ever, and true to his friend. Agrees with my feelings to a
comma. He thinks Cadell's account must turn up trumps, and is for going
the vole.<a name="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>November</i> 7.&mdash;Began to settle myself this morning, after the hurry of
mind, and even of body, which I have lately undergone. Commenced a
review&mdash;that is, an essay, on Ornamental Gardening for the <i>Quarterly</i>.
But I stuck fast for want of books. As I did not wish to leave the mind
leisure to recoil on itself, I immediately began the Second Series of
the <i>Chronicles of Canongate</i>, the First having been well approved. I
went to make another visit, and fairly softened myself like an old fool,
with recalling old stories <a name="Page_62"></a><a name="Page_63"></a>till I was fit for nothing but shedding
tears and repeating verses for the whole night. This is sad work. The
very grave gives up its dead, and time rolls back thirty years to add to
my perplexities. I don't care. I begin to grow over-hardened, and, like
a stag turning at bay, my naturally good temper grows fierce and
dangerous. Yet what a romance to tell, and told I fear it will one day
be. And then my three years of dreaming and my two years of wakening
will be chronicled doubtless. But the dead will feel no pain.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 8.&mdash;<i>Domum mansi, lanam feci</i>. I may borrow the old
sepulchral motto of the Roman matron. I stayed at home, and began the
third volume of <i>Chronicles</i>, or rather the first volume of the Second
Series.<a name="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> This I pursued with little intermission from morning till
night, yet only finished nine pages. Like the machinery of a
steam-engine, the imagination does not work freely when first set upon a
new task.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 9.&mdash;Finished my task after breakfast, at least before twelve.
Then went to College to hear this most amusing good matter of the Essay
read.<a name="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> <i>Imprimis</i> occurs a dispute whether the magistrates, as
patrons of the University, should march in procession before the Royal
visitors; and it was proposed on our side that the Provost, who is
undoubtedly the first man in his own city, should go in attendance on
the Principal, with the Chairman of the Commission on the Principal's
right hand, and the whole <a name="Page_64"></a>Commission following, taking <i>pas</i> of the
other Magistrates as well as of the Senatus Academicus&mdash;or whether we
had not better waive all question of precedence, and let the three
bodies find their way separately as they best could. This last method
was just adopted when we learned that the question was not in what order
of procession we should reach the place of exhibition, but whether we
were to get there at all, which was presently after reported as an
impossibility. The lads of the College had so effectually taken
possession of the class-room where the essay was to be read, that,
neither learning or law, neither Magistrates nor Magisters, neither
visitors nor visited, could make way to the scene of action. So we
grandees were obliged to adjourn the sederunt till Saturday the
17th&mdash;and so ended the collie-shangie.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 10.&mdash;Wrote out my task and little more. At twelve o'clock I
went to poor Lady J.S. to talk over old stories. I am not clear that it
is right or healthful indulgence to be ripping up old sorrows, but it
seems to give her deep-seated sorrow words, and that is a mental
bloodletting. To me these things are now matter of calm and solemn
recollection, never to be forgotten, yet scarce to be remembered with
pain.</p>

<p>We go out to Saint Catherine's<a name="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> to-day. I am glad of it, for I would
not have these recollections haunt me, and society will put them out of
my head.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 11.&mdash;Sir William Rae read us prayers. Sauntered about the
doors, and talked of old cavalry stories. Then drove to Melville, and
saw the Lord and Lady, and family. I think I never saw anything more
beautiful than the ridge of Carnethy (Pentland) against a clear frosty
sky, with its peaks and varied slopes. The hills glowed like purple
amethysts, the sky glowed topaz and vermilion colours. I never saw a
finer screen than <a name="Page_65"></a>Pentland, considering that it is neither rocky nor
highly elevated.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 12.&mdash;I cannot say I lost a minute's sleep on account of what
the day might bring forth; though it was that on which we must settle
with Abud in his Jewish demand, or stand to the consequences. I
breakfasted with an excellent appetite, laughed in real genuine easy
fun, and went to Edinburgh, resolved to do what should best become me.
When I came home I found Walter, poor fellow, who had come down on the
spur, having heard from John Lockhart how things stand. Gibson having
taken out a suspension makes us all safe for the present. So we dined
merrily. He has good hopes of his Majesty, and I must support his
interest as well as I can. Wrote letters to Lady Shelley, John L., and
one or two chance correspondents. One was singular. A gentleman, writing
himself James Macturk, tells me his friends have identified him with
Captain Macturk of St. Ronan's Well, and finding himself much
inconvenienced by this identification, he proposes I should apply to the
King to forward his restoration and advance in the service (he writes
himself late Lieutenant 4th Dragoon Guards) as an atonement for having
occasioned him (though unintentionally no doubt) so great an injury.
This is one road to promotion, to be sure. Lieutenant Macturk is, I
suppose, tolerably mad.</p>

<p>We dined together, Anne, Walter, and I, and were happy at our reunion,
when, as I was despatching my packet to London,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>In started to heeze up our howp<a name="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>John Gibson, radiant with good-natured joy. He had another letter from
Cadell, enclosing one from Robinson, in which the latter pledges himself
to make the most explicit affidavit.</p>

<p>On these two last days I have written only three pages, <a name="Page_66"></a>but not from
inaptitude or incapacity to labour. It is odd enough&mdash;I think it
difficult to place me in a situation of danger, or disagreeable
circumstances, purely personal, which would shake my powers of mind, yet
they sink under mere lowness of spirits, as this Journal bears evidence
in too many passages.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 13.&mdash;Wrote a little in the morning, but not above a page.
Went to the Court about one, returned, and made several visits with Anne
and Walter. Cadell came, glorious with the success of his expedition,
but a little allayed by the prospect of competition for the copyrights,
on which he and I have our eyes as joint purchasers. We must have them
if possible, for I can give new value to an edition corrected with
notes. <i>Nous verrons!</i> Captain Musgrave, of the house of Edenhall, dined
with us. After dinner, while we were over our whisky and water and
cigars, enter the merry knight. Misses Kerr came to tea, and we had fun
and singing in the evening.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 14.&mdash;A little work in the morning, but no gathering to my
tackle. Went to Court, remained till nigh one. Then came through a
pitiless shower; dressed and went to the christening of a boy of John
Richardson's who was baptized Henry Cockburn. Read the <i>Gazette</i> of the
great battle of Navarino, in which we have thumped the Turks very well.
But as to the justice of our interference, I will only suppose some
Turkish plenipotentiary, with an immense turban and long loose trousers,
comes to dictate to us the mode in which we should deal with our
refractory liegemen the Catholics of Ireland. We hesitate to admit his
interference, on which the Moslem admiral runs into Cork Bay or Bantry
Bay, alongside of a British squadron, and sends a boat to tow aside a
fire-ship. A vessel fires on the boat and sinks her. Is there an
aggression on the part of those who fired first, or of those whose
manoeuvres occasioned the firing?</p><a name="Page_67"></a>

<p>Dined at Henry Cockburn's with the christening party.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 15.&mdash;Wrote a little in the morning. Detained in Court till
two; then returned home wet enough. Met with Chambers, and complimented
him about his making a clever book of the 1745 for Constable's
<i>Miscellany</i>. It is really a lively work, and must have a good sale.
Before dinner enter Cadell, and we anxiously renewed our plan for buying
the copyrights on 19th December. It is most essential that the whole of
the Waverley Novels should be kept under our management, as it is
called. I may then give them a new impulse by a preface and notes; and
if an edition, of say 30 volumes, were to be published monthly to the
tune of 5000, which may really be expected if the shops were once
cleared of the over-glut, it would bring in &pound;10,000 clear profit, over
all outlay, and so pay any sum of copy-money that might be ventured. I
must urge these things to Gibson, for except these copyrights be saved
our plans will go to nothing.</p>

<p>Walter and Anne went to hear Madame Pasta sing after dinner. I remained
at home; wrote to Sir William Knighton, and sundry other letters of
importance.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 16.&mdash;There was little to do in Court to-day, but one's time
is squandered, and his ideas broken strangely. At three we had a select
meeting of the Gas Directors to consider what line we were to take in
the disastrous affairs of the company. Agreed to go to Parliament a
second time. James Gibson [Craig] and I to go up as our solicitors. So
curiously does interest couple up individuals, though I am sure I have
no objection whatever to Mr. James Gibson-Craig.<a name="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>November</i> 17.&mdash;Returned home in early time from the Court. Settled on
the review of Ornamental Gardening <a name="Page_68"></a>for Lockhart, and wrote hard. Want
several quotations, though&mdash;that is the bore of being totally without
books. Anne and I dined quietly together, and I wrote after tea&mdash;an
industrious day.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 18.&mdash;This has been also a day of exertion. I was interrupted
for a moment by a visit from young Davidoff with a present of a steel
snuff-box [Tula work], wrought and lined with gold, having my arms on
the top, and on the sides various scenes from the environs and principal
public buildings of St. Petersburg&mdash;a <i>joli cadeau</i>&mdash;and I take it very
kind of my young friend. I had a letter from his uncle, Denis Davidoff,
the black captain of the French retreat. The Russians are certainly
losing ground and men in Persia, and will not easily get out of the
scrape of having engaged an active enemy in a difficult and unhealthy
country. I am glad of it; it is an overgrown power; and to have them
kept quiet at least is well for the rest of Europe. I concluded the
evening&mdash;after writing a double task&mdash;with the trial of Malcolm
Gillespie, renowned as a most venturous excise officer, but now like to
lose his life for forgery. A bold man in his vocation he seems to have
been, but the law seems to have got round to the wrong side of him on
the present occasion.<a name="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>November</i> 19.&mdash;Corrected the last proof of <i>Tales of my Grandfather</i>.
Received Cadell at breakfast, and conversed fully on the subject of the
<i>Chronicles</i> and the application of the price of 2d series, say &pound;4000,
to the purchase of the moiety of the copyrights now in the market, and
to be sold this day month. If I have the command of a new Edition and
put it into an attractive shape, with notes, introductions, and
illustrations that no one save I myself can give, I am confident it will
bring home the whole purchase-money with <a name="Page_69"></a>something over, and lead to
the disposal of a series of the subsequent volumes of the following
works,</p>

St. Ronan's Well,        3 vols.<br />
Redgauntlet,             3 &quot;<br />
Tales of Crusaders,      4 &quot;<br />
Woodstock,               3 &quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">&mdash;&mdash;-</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">13</span><br />

<p>make a series of 7 vols.! The two series of the <i>Chronicles</i> and others
will be ready about the same time.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 20.&mdash;Wrought in the morning at the review, which I fear will
be lengthy. Called on Hector as I came home from the Court, and found
him better, and keeping a Highland heart. I came home like a crow
through the mist, half dead with a rheumatic headache caused by the
beastly north-east wind.</p>

<p>&quot;What am I now when every breeze appals me?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> I dozed for
half-an-hour in my chair for pain and stupidity. I omitted to say
yesterday that I went out to Melville Castle to inquire after my Lord
Melville, who had broke his collar-bone by a fall from his horse in
mounting. He is recovering well, but much bruised. I came home with Lord
Chief-Commissioner Adam. He told me a dictum of old Sir Gilbert Elliot,
speaking of his uncles. &quot;No chance of opulence,&quot; he said, &quot;is worth the
risk of a competence.&quot; It was not the thought of a great man, but
perhaps that of a wise one. Wrought at my review, and despatched about
half or better, I should hope. I incline to longer extracts in the next
sheets.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 21.&mdash;Wrought at the review. At one o'clock I attended the
general meeting of the Union Scottish Assurance Company. There was a
debate arose whether the ordinary acting directors should or should not
have a small sum, amounting to about a crown a piece allotted to them
each day of their regular attendance. The proposal was rejected by many,
and upon grounds which sound very well,&mdash;such <a name="Page_70"></a>as the shabbiness of men
being influenced by a trifling consideration like this, and the
absurdity of the Company volunteering a bounty to one set of men, when
there are others willing to act gratuitously, and many gentlemen
volunteered their own services; though I cannot help suspecting that, as
in the case of ultroneous offers of service upon most occasions, it was
not likely to be acceptable. The motion miscarried, however&mdash;impoliticly
rejected, as I think. The sound of five shillings sounds shabby, but the
fact is that it does in some sort reconcile the party to whom it is
offered to leave his own house and business at an exact hour; whereas,
in the common case, one man comes too late&mdash;another does not come at
all&mdash;the attendance is given by different individuals upon different
days, so that no one acquires the due historical knowledge of the
affairs of the Company. Besides, the Directors, by taking even this
trifling sum of money, render themselves the paid servants of the
Company, and are bound to use a certain degree of diligence, much
greater than if they continued to serve, as hitherto, gratuitously. The
pay is like enlisting money which, whether great or small, subjects to
engagements under the Articles of war.</p>

<p>A china-merchant spoke,&mdash;a picture of an orator with bandy legs,
squinting eyes, and a voice like an ungreased cart-wheel&mdash;a liberty boy,
I suppose. The meeting was somewhat stormy, but I preserved order by
listening with patience to each in turn; determined that they should
weary out the patience of the meeting before I lost mine. An orator is
like a top. Let him alone and he must stop one time or another&mdash;flog
him, and he may go on for ever.</p>

<p>Dined with Directors, of whom I only knew the Manager, Sutherland
Mackenzie, Sir David Milne, and Wauchope, besides one or two old Oil Gas
friends. It went off well enough.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 22.&mdash;Wrought in the morning. Then made <a name="Page_71"></a>arrangements for a
dinner to celebrate the Duke of Buccleuch coming of age&mdash;that which was
to have been held at Melville Castle being postponed, owing to Lord M.'s
accident. Sent copy of Second Series of <i>Chronicles of Canongate</i> to
Ballantyne.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 23.&mdash;I bilked the Court to-day, and worked at the review. I
wish it may not be too long, yet know not how to shorten it. The post
brought me a letter from the Duke of Buccleuch, acquainting me with his
grandmother, the Duchess-Dowager's death.<a name="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> She was a woman of
unbounded beneficence to, and even beyond, the extent of her princely
fortune. She had a masculine courage, and great firmness in enduring
affliction, which pressed on her with continued and successive blows in
her later years. She was about eighty-four, and nature was exhausted; so
life departed like the extinction of a lamp for lack of oil. Our dinner
on Monday is put off. I am not superstitious, but I wish this festival
had not been twice delayed by such sinister accidents&mdash;first, the injury
sustained by Lord Melville, and then this event spreading crape like the
shroud of Saladin over our little festival.<a name="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> God avert bad omens!</p>

<p>Dined with Archie Swinton. Company&mdash;Sir Alexander and Lady Keith, Mr.
and Mrs. Anderson, Clanronald, etc. Clanronald told us, as an instance
of Highland credulity, that a set of his kinsmen, Borradale and others,
believing that the fabulous Water Cow inhabited a small lake near his
house, resolved to drag the monster into day. With this view they
bivouacked by the side of the lake, in which they placed, by way of
night-bait, two small anchors, such as belong to boats, each baited with
the carcase of a dog slain for the purpose. They expected the Water Cow
would gorge on this bait, and were prepared to drag her ashore the next
morning, when, to <a name="Page_72"></a>their confusion of face, the baits were found
untouched. It is something too late in the day for setting baits for
Water Cows.<a name="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>November</i> 24.&mdash;Wrote at review in the morning. I have made my
revocation of the invitation for Monday. For myself it will give me time
to work. I could not get home to-day till two o'clock, and was quite
tired and stupid. So I did little but sleep or dose till dressing-time.
Then went to Sir David Wedderburn's, where I met three beauties of my
own day, Margaret Brown, Maria Brown, and Jane Wedderburn, now Lady
Wedderburn, Lady Hampden, and Mrs. Oliphant. We met the pleasant Irish
family of Meath. The resemblance between the Earl of Meath and the Duke
of Wellington is something remarkably striking&mdash;it is not only the
profile, but the mode of bearing the person, and the person itself. Lady
Theodora Brabazon, the Earl's daughter, and a beautiful young lady, told
me that in Paris her father was often taken for Lord Wellington.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 25.&mdash;This forenoon finished the review, and despatched it to
Lockhart before dinner. Will Clerk, Tom Thomson, and young Frank Scott
dined with me. We had a pleasant day. I have wrought pretty well to-day.
But I must</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Do a little more<br /></span>
<span>And produce a little ore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a name="Page_73"></a><i>November</i> 26.&mdash;Corrected proof-sheets of <i>Chronicles</i> and <i>Tales</i>.
Advised Sheriff processes, and was busy.</p>

<p>Dined with Robert Dundas of Arniston, Lord Register, etc. An agreeable
evening.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 27.&mdash;Corrected proofs in the morning, and attended the Court
till one or two o'clock, Mr. Hamilton being again ill. I visited Lady S.
on my return. Came home too fagged to do anything to purpose.</p>

<p>Anecdote from George Bell. In the days of Charles II. or his brother,
flourished an old Lady Elphinstone, so old that she reached the
extraordinary period of 103. She was a keen Whig, so did not relish
Graham of Clavers. At last, having a curiosity to see so aged a person,
he obtained or took permission to see her, and asked her of the
remarkable things she had seen. &quot;Indeed,&quot; said she, &quot;I think one of the
most remarkable is, that when I entered the world there was one Knox
deaving us a' with his clavers, and now that I am going out of it, there
is one Clavers deaving us with his knocks.&quot;</p>

<p><i>November</i> 28.&mdash;Corrected proofs and went to Court. Returned about one,
and called on the Lord Chief-Baron. Dined with the Duchess of Bedford at
the Waterloo, and renewed, as I may say, an old acquaintance, which
began while her Grace was Lady Georgiana.<a name="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> She has now a fine family,
two young ladies silent just now, but they will find their tongues, or
they are not right Gordons, a very fine child, Alister, who shouted,
sung, and spoke Gaelic with much spirit. They are from a shooting-place
in the Highlands, called Invereshie, in Badenoch, which the Duke has
taken to gratify the Duchess's passion for the heather.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 29.&mdash;My course of composition is stopped foolishly enough. I
have sent four leaves to London with Lockhart's review. I am very sorry
for this blunder, and here is another. Forgetting I had been engaged for
a long time to Lord Gillies&mdash;a first family visit too&mdash;the devil
<a name="Page_74"></a>tempted me to accept of the office of President of the Antiquarian
Society. And now they tell me people have come from the country to be
present, and so forth, of which I may believe as much as I may. But I
must positively take care of this absurd custom of confounding
invitations. My conscience acquits me of doing so by malice <i>prepense</i>,
yet one incurs the suspicion. At any rate it is uncivil and must be
amended. Dined at Lord C. Commissioner's&mdash;to meet the Duchess and her
party. She can be extremely agreeable, but I used to think her Grace
<i>journali&egrave;re</i>. She may have been cured of that fault, or I may have
turned less jealous of my dignity. At all events let a pleasant hour go
by unquestioned, and do not let us break ordinary gems to pieces because
they are not diamonds. I forgot to say Edwin Landseer was in the
Duchess's train. He is, in my mind, one of the most striking masters of
the modern school. His expression both in man and animals is capital. He
showed us many sketches of smugglers, etc., taken in the Highlands, all
capital.</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>November</i> 30.&mdash;Another idle morning, with letters, however. Had the
great pleasure of a letter from Lord Dudley<a name="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> acquainting me that he
had received his Majesty's commands to put down the name of my son
Charles for the first vacancy that should occur in the Foreign Office,
and at the same time to acquaint me with his gracious intentions, which
were signified in language the most gratifying to me. This makes me
really feel light and happy, and most grateful to the kind and gracious
sovereign who has always shown, I may say, so much friendship towards
me. Would to God <i>the King's errand might lie in the cadger's gait</i>,
that I might have <a name="Page_75"></a>some better way of showing my gratitude than merely
by a letter of thanks or this private memorandum of my gratitude. The
lad is a good boy and clever, somewhat indolent I fear, yet with the
capacity of exertion. Presuming his head is full enough of Greek and
Latin, he has now living languages to study; so I will set him to work
on French, Italian, and German, that, like the classic Cerberus, he may
speak a leash of languages at once. Dined with Gillies, very pleasant;
Lord Chief-Commissioner, Will Clerk, Cranstoun, and other old friends. I
saw in the evening the celebrated Miss Grahame Stirling, so remarkable
for her power of personifying a Scottish old lady. Unluckily she came
late, and I left early in the evening, so I could not find out wherein
her craft lay. She looked like a sensible woman. I had a conference with
my trustees about the purchase (in company with Cadell) of the
copyrights of the novels to be exposed to sale on the 19th December, and
had the good luck to persuade them fully of the propriety of the
project. I alone can, by notes and the like, give these works a new
value, and in fact make a new edition. The price is to be made good from
the Second Series <i>Chronicles of Canongate</i>, sold to Cadell for &pound;4000;
and it may very well happen that we shall have little to pay, as part of
the copyrights will probably be declared mine by the arbiter, and these
I shall have without money and without price. Cadell is most anxious on
the subject. He thinks that two years hence &pound;10,000 may be made of a new
edition.</p><a name="Page_76"></a>

<a name="DECEMBER_1827"></a><h2>DECEMBER.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>December</i> 1.&mdash;This morning again I was idle. But I must work, and so I
will to-morrow whether the missing sheets arrive, ay or no, by goles!
After Court I went with Lord Wriothesley Russell,<a name="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> to Dalkeith House,
to see the pictures; Charles K. Sharpe alongst with us. We satisfied
ourselves that they have actually frames, and that, I think, was all we
could be sure of. Lord Wriothesley, who is a very pleasant young man,
well-informed, and with some turn for humour, dined with us, and Mr.
Davidoff met him. The Misses Kerr also dined and spent the evening with
us in that sort of society which I like best. Charles Sharpe came in and
we laughed over oysters and sherry,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And a fig for your Sultan and Sophi.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>December</i> 2.&mdash;Laboured to make lee-way, and finished nearly seven pages
to eke on to the end of the missing sheets when returned. I have yoked
Charles to Monsieur Surenne, an old soldier in Napoleon's Italian army,
and I think a clever little fellow, with good general ideas of
etymology. Signor Bugnie is a good Italian teacher; and for a German,
why, I must look about. It is not the least useful language of the
leash.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 3.&mdash;A day of petty business, which killed a holiday. Finished
my tale of the Mirror;<a name="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> went with Tom Allan to see his building at
Lauriston, where he has displayed good taste&mdash;supporting instead of
tearing down or destroying the old chateau, which once belonged to the
famous Mississippi Law. The additions are in very good taste, and will
make a most comfortable house. Mr. Burn, architect, <a name="Page_77"></a>would fain have had
the old house pulled down, which I wonder at in him,<a name="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> though it would
have been the practice of most of his brethren. When I came up to town I
was just in time for the Bannatyne Club, where things are going on
reasonably well. I hope we may get out some good historical documents in
the course of the winter. Dined at the Royal Society Club. At the
society had some essays upon the specific weight of the ore of
manganese, which was caviare to the President, and I think most of the
members. But it seemed extremely accurate, and I have little doubt was
intelligible to those who had the requisite key. We supped at Mr.
Russell's, where the conversation was as gay as usual. Lieut-Col.
Ferguson was my guest at the dinner.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 4.&mdash;Had the agreeable intelligence that Lord Newton had
finally issued his decree in my favour, for all the money in the bank,
amounting to &pound;32,000. This will make a dividend of six shillings in the
pound, which is presently to be paid. A meeting of the creditors was
held to-day, at which they gave unanimous approbation of all that has
been done, and seemed struck by the exertions which had produced &pound;22,000
within so short a space. They all separated well pleased. So far so
good. Heaven grant the talisman break not! I sent copy to Ballantyne
this morning, having got back the missing sheets from John Lockhart last
night. I feel a little puzzled about the character and style of the next
tale. The world has had so much of chivalry. Well, I will <a name="Page_78"></a>dine merrily,
and thank God, and bid care rest till to-morrow. How suddenly things are
overcast, and how suddenly the sun can break out again! On the 31st
October I was dreaming as little of such a thing as at present, when
behold there came tidings which threatened a total interruption of the
amicable settlement of my affairs, and menaced my own personal liberty.
In less than a month we are enabled to turn chase on my persecutors, who
seem in a fair way of losing their recourse upon us. <i>Non nobis,
Domine</i>.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 5.&mdash;I did a good deal in the way of preparing my new tale,
and resolved to make something out of the story of Harry Wynd. The North
Inch of Perth would be no bad name, and it may be possible to make a
difference betwixt the old Highlander and him of modern date. The fellow
that swam the Tay, and escaped, would be a good ludicrous character. But
I have a mind to try him in the serious line of tragedy. Miss Baillie
has made the Ethling<a name="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> a coward by temperament, and a hero when
touched by filial affection. Suppose a man's nerves supported by
feelings of honour, or say by the spur of jealousy supporting him
against constitutional timidity to a certain point, then suddenly giving
way,&mdash;I think something tragic might be produced. James Ballantyne's
criticism is too much moulded upon the general taste of novels to admit,
I fear, this species of reasoning. But what can one do? I am hard up as
far as imagination is concerned, yet the world calls for novelty. Well,
I'll try my brave coward or cowardly brave man. <i>Valeat quantum</i>. Being
a teind day, remained at home, adjusting my ideas on this point until
one o'clock, then walked as far as Mr. Cadell's. Finally, went to dine
at Hawkhill with Lord and Lady Binning. Party were Lord
Chief-Commissioner, Lord Chief-Baron, Solicitor, John Wilson, Lord
Corehouse. The night was so dark and stormy that I was glad when we got
upon the paved streets.</p>
<a name="Page_79"></a>
<p><i>December</i> 6.&mdash;Corrected proofs and went to Court. Bad news of Ahab's
case. I hope he won't beat us after all. It would be mortifying to have
them paid in full, as they must be while better men must lie by. <i>Spero
meliora</i>.</p>

<p>I think that copy of Beard's <i>Judgments</i> is the first book which I have
voluntarily purchased for nearly two years. So I am cured of one folly
at least.<a name="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>December</i> 7.&mdash;Being a blank day in the rolls, I stayed at home and
wrote four leaves&mdash;not very freely or happily; I was not in the vein.
Plague on it! Stayed at home the whole day. There is one thing I believe
peculiar to me&mdash;I work, that is, meditate for the purpose of working,
best, when I have a <i>quasi</i> engagement with some other book for example.
When I find myself doing ill, or like to come to a stand-still in
writing, I take up some slight book, a novel or the like, and usually
have not read far ere my difficulties are removed, and I am ready to
write again. There must be two currents of ideas going on in my mind at
the same time,<a name="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> or perhaps the slighter occupation serves like a
woman's wheel or stocking to ballast the mind, as it were, by preventing
the thoughts from wandering, and so give the deeper current the power to
flow undisturbed. I always laugh when I hear people say, Do one thing at
once. I have done a dozen things at once all my life. Dined with the
family. After dinner Lockhart's proofs came in and occupied me for the
evening. I wish I have not made that article too long, and Lockhart will
not snip away.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 8.&mdash;Went to Court and stayed there a good while. Made some
consultations in the Advocates' Library, not furiously to the purpose.</p>

<p>Court in the morning. Sent off Lockhart's proof, which I hope will do
him some good. A precatory letter from <a name="Page_80"></a>Gillies. I must do Moli&egrave;re for
him, I suppose; but it is wonderful that knowing the situation I am in,
the poor fellow presses so hard. Sure, I am pulling for life, and it is
hard to ask me to pull another man's oar as well as my own. Yet, if I
can give a little help,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;We'll get a blessing wi' the lave,<br /></span>
<span>And never miss 't.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Went to John Murray's, where were Sir John Dalrymple and Lady, Sir John
Cayley, Mr. Hope Vere, and Lady Elizabeth Vere, a sister of the Marquis
of Tweeddale, and a pleasant sensible woman. Some turn for antiquity too
she shows&mdash;and spoke a good deal of the pictures at Yester. Henderland
was there too. Mrs. John Murray made some very agreeable music.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 9.&mdash;I set hard to work, and had a long day with my new tale.
I did about twelve leaves. Cadell came in, and we talked upon the great
project of buying in the copyrights. He is disposed to <i>finesse</i> a
little about it, but I do not think it will do much good; all the fine
arguments will fly off and people just bid or not bid as the report of
the trade may represent the speculation as a good or bad one. I daresay
they will reach &pound;7000; but &pound;8000 won't stop us, and that for books
over-printed so lately and to such an extent is a pro-di-gi-ous price!</p>

<p><i>December</i> 10.&mdash;I corrected proofs and forwarded copy. Went out for an
hour to Lady J.S. Home and dozed a little, half stupefied with a cold in
my head&mdash;made up this Journal, however. Settled I would go to Abbotsford
on the 24th from Arniston. Before that time I trust the business of the
copyrights will be finally settled. If they can be had on anything like
fair terms, they will give the greatest chance I can see of extricating
my affairs. Cadell seems to be quite confident in the advantage of
making the purchase upon almost any terms, and truly I am of his
opinion. If <a name="Page_81"></a>they get out of Scotland it will not be all I can do that
will enable me to write myself a free man during the space I have to
remain in this world.</p>

<p>I smoked a couple of cigars for the first time since I came from the
country; and as Anne and Charles went to the play, I muddled away the
evening over my Sheriff-Court processes, and despatched a hugeous parcel
to Will Scott at Selkirk. It is always something off hand.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 11.&mdash;Wrote a little, and seemed to myself to get on. I went
also to Court. On return, had a formal communication from Ballantyne,
enclosing a letter from Cadell of an unpleasant tenor. It seems Mr.
Cadell is dissatisfied with the moderate success of the First Series of
<i>Chronicles;</i><a name="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> and disapproves of about half the volume already
written of the Second Series, obviously rueing his engagement. I have
replied that I was not fool enough to suppose that my favour with the
public could last for ever, and was neither shocked nor alarmed to find
that it had ceased now, as cease it must one day soon; it might he
inconvenient for me in some respects, but I would be quite contented to
resign the bargain rather than that more loss should be incurred. I saw,
I told them, no other receipt than lying lea for a little, while taking
a fallow-break to relieve my imagination, which may be esteemed nearly
cropped out. I can make shift for myself amid this failure of prospects;
but I think both Cadell and J.B. will be probable sufferers. However,
they are very right to speak their mind, and may be esteemed tolerably
good representatives of the popular taste. So I really think their
censure may be a good reason for laying aside this work, though I may
preserve some part of it till another day.</p>
<a name="Page_82"></a>
<p><i>December</i> 12.&mdash;Reconsidered the probable downfall of my literary
reputation. I am so constitutionally indifferent to the censure or
praise of the world, that never having abandoned myself to the feelings
of self-conceit which my great success was calculated to inspire, I can
look with the most unshaken firmness upon the event as far as my own
feelings are concerned. If there be any great advantage in literary
reputation, I have had it, and I certainly do not care for losing it.</p>

<p>They cannot say but what I <i>had</i> the <i>crown</i>. It is unhappily
inconvenient for my affairs to lay by my [work] just now, and that is
the only reason why I do not give up literary labour; but, at least, I
will not push the losing game of novel-writing. I will take back the
sheets now objected to, but it cannot be expected that I am to write
upon return. I cannot but think that a little thought will open some
plan of composition which may promise novelty at the least. I suppose I
shall hear from or see these gentlemen to-day; if not, I must send for
them to-morrow. How will this affect the plan of going shares with
Cadell in the novels of earlier and happier date? Very-much, I doubt,
seeing I cannot lay down the cash. But surely the trustees may find some
mode of providing this, or else with cash to secure these copyrights. At
any rate, I will gain a little time for thought and discussion.</p>

<p>Went to Court. At returning settled with Chief-Commissioner that I
should receive him on 26th December at Abbotsford.</p>

<p>After all, may there not be, in this failure to please, some reliques of
the very unfavourable matters in which I have been engaged of late,&mdash;the
threat of imprisonment, the resolution to become insolvent? I cannot
feel that there is. What I suffer by is the difficulty of not setting my
foot upon such ground as I have trod before, and thus instead of
attaining novelty I lose spirit and nature. On the other <a name="Page_83"></a>hand, who
would 'thank me for &quot;repented sheets&quot;? Here is a good joke enough, lost
to all who have not known the Clerk's table before the Jurisdiction Act.</p>

<p>My two learned Thebans are arrived, and departed after a long
consultation. They deprecated a fallow-break as ruin. I set before them
my own sense of the difficulties and risks in which I must be involved
by perseverance, and showed them I could occupy my own time as well for
six months or a twelvemonth, and let the public gather an appetite. They
replied (and therein was some risk) that the expectation would in that
case be so much augmented that it would be impossible for any mortal to
gratify it. To this is to be added what they did not touch upon&mdash;the
risk of being thrust aside altogether, which is the case with the horses
that neglect keeping the lead when once they have got it. Finally, we
resolved the present work should go on, leaving out some parts of the
Introduction which they object to. They are good specimens of the public
taste in general; and it is far best to indulge and yield to them,
unless I was very, <i>very</i> certain that I was right and they wrong.
Besides, I am not afraid of their being hypercritical in the
circumstances, being both sensible men, and not inclined to sacrifice
chance of solid profit to the vagaries of critical taste. So the word is
&quot;as you were.&quot;</p>

<p><i>December</i> 13.&mdash;A letter from Lockhart announcing that Murray of
Albemarle Street would willingly give me my own terms for a volume on
the subject of planting and landscape gardening. This will amuse me very
much indeed. Another proposal invites me, on the part of Colburn, to
take charge of the Garrick papers. The papers are to be edited by
Colman, and then it is proposed to me to write a life of Garrick in
quarto.<a name="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> Lockhart refused a thousand pounds <a name="Page_84"></a>which were offered, and
<i>carte blanche</i> was then sent. But I will not budge. My book and
Colman's would run each other down. It is an attempt to get more from
the public out of the subject than they will endure. Besides, my name
would be only useful in the way of <i>puff</i>, for I really know nothing of
the subject. So I will refuse; that's flat.</p>

<p>Having turned over my thoughts with some anxiety about the important
subject of yesterday, I think we have done for the best. If I can rally
this time, as I did in the Crusaders, why, there is the old trade open
yet. If not, retirement will come gracefully after my failure. I must
get the return of the sales of the three or four last novels so as to
judge what style of composition has best answered. Add to this, giving
up just now loses &pound;4000 to the trustees, which they would not
understand, whatever may be my nice authorial feelings. And moreover, it
ensures the purchase of the copyrights&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> almost ensures them.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 14.&mdash;Summoned to pay arrears of our unhappy Oil Gas
concern&mdash;&pound;140&mdash;which I performed by draft on Mr. Cadell. This will pinch
a little close, but it is a debt of honour, and must be paid. The public
will never bear a public man who shuns either to draw his purse or his
sword when there is an open and honest demand on him.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 15.&mdash;Worked in the morning on the sheets which are to be
cancelled, and on the Tale of <i>St. Valentine's Eve</i>&mdash;a good title, by
the way. Had the usual <i>quantum sufficit</i> of the Court, which, if it did
not dissipate one's attention so much, is rather an amusement than
otherwise. But the plague is to fix one's attention to the sticking
point, after it has been squandered about for two or three hours in such
a way. It keeps one, however, in the course and stream of actual life,
which is a great advantage to a literary man.</p>

<p>I missed an appointment, for which I am very sorry. It was about our
Advocates' Library, which is to be rebuilt. During all my life we have
mismanaged the large funds <a name="Page_85"></a>expended on the rooms of our library,
totally mistaking the objects for which a library is built; and instead
of taking a general and steady view of the subject, patching up
disconnected and ill-sized rooms, totally unequal to answer the
accommodation demanded, and bestowing an absurd degree of ornament and
finery upon the internal finishing. All this should be reversed: the new
library should be calculated upon a plan which ought to suffice for all
the nineteenth century at least, and for that purpose should admit of
being executed progressively; then there should be no ornament other
than that of strict architectural proportion, and the rooms should be
accessible one through another, but divided with so many partitions, as
to give ample room for shelves. These small rooms would also facilitate
the purposes of study. Something of a lounging room would not be amiss,
which might serve for meetings of Faculty occasionally. I ought to take
some interest in all this, and I do. So I will attend the next meeting
of committee. Dined at Baron Hume's, and met General Campbell of
Lochnell, and his lady.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 16.&mdash;Worked hard to-day and only took a half hour's walk with
Hector Macdonald! Colin Mackenzie unwell; his asthma seems rather to
increase, notwithstanding his foreign trip! Alas! long-seated complaints
defy Italian climate. We had a small party to dinner. Captain and Mrs.
Hamilton, Davidoff, Frank Scott, Harden, and his chum Charles Baillie,
second son of Mellerstain, who seems a clever young man.<a name="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> Two or
three of the party stayed to take wine and water.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 17.&mdash;Sent off the beginning of the <i>Chronicles</i> to
Ballantyne. I hate cancels; they are a double labour.</p>

<p>Mr. Cowan, Trustee for Constable's creditors, called in the morning by
appointment, and we talked about the upset price of the copyrights of
Waverley, etc. I frankly told him <a name="Page_86"></a>that I was so much concerned that
they should remain more or less under my control, that I was willing,
with the advice of my trustees, to offer a larger upset than that of
&pound;4750, which had been fixed, and that I proposed the price set up should
be &pound;250 for the poetry, Paul's letters, etc., and &pound;5250 for the novels,
in all &pound;5500; but that I made this proposal under the condition, that in
case no bidding should ensue, then the copyrights should be mine so soon
as the sale was adjourned, without any one being permitted to bid after
the sale. It is to be hoped this high upset price will</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Fright the fuds<br /></span>
<span>Of the pock-puds.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This speculation may be for good or for evil, but it tends incalculably
to increase the value of such copyrights as remain in my own person;
and, if a handsome and cheap edition of the whole, with notes, can be
instituted in conformity with Cadell's plan, it must prove a mine of
wealth, three-fourths of which will belong to me or my creditors. It is
possible, no doubt, that the works may lose their effect on the public
mind; but this must be risked, and I think the chances are greatly in
our favour. Death (my own I mean) would improve the property, since an
edition with a Life would sell like wildfire. Perhaps those who read
this prophecy may shake their heads and say, &quot;Poor fellow, he little
thought how he should see the public interest in him and his
extinguished even during his natural existence.&quot; It may be so, but I
will hope better. This I know, that no literary speculation ever
succeeded with me but where my own works were concerned; and that, on
the other hand, these have rarely failed. And so&mdash;<i>Vogue la gal&egrave;re!</i></p>

<p>Dined with the Lord Chief-Commissioner, and met Lord and Lady Binning,
Lord and Lady Abercromby, Sir Robert O'Callaghan, etc. These dinners put
off time well enough, and I write so painfully by candle-light that they
do not greatly interfere with business.</p>

<p><a name="Page_87"></a><i>December</i> 18.&mdash;Poor Huntly Gordon writes me in despair about &pound;180 of
debt which he has incurred. He wishes to publish two sermons which I
wrote for him when he was taking orders; but he would get little money
for them without my name, and that is at present out of the question.
People would cry out against the undesired and unwelcome zeal of him who
stretched out his hands to help the ark with the best intentions, and
cry sacrilege. And yet they would do me gross injustice, for I would, if
called upon, die a martyr for the Christian religion, so completely is
(in my poor opinion) its divine origin proved by its beneficial effects
on the state of society. Were we but to name the abolition of slavery
and of polygamy, how much has in these two words been granted to mankind
by the lessons of our Saviour!<a name="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>December</i> 19.&mdash;Wrought upon an introduction to the notices which have
been recovered of George Bannatyne,<a name="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> author, or rather transcriber,
of the famous Repository of Scottish Poetry, generally known by the
Bannatyne MS. They are very <i>jejune</i> these same notices&mdash;a mere record
of matters of business, putting forth and calling in of sums of money,
and such like. Yet it is a satisfaction to learn that this great
benefactor to the literature of Scotland lived a prosperous life, and
enjoyed the pleasures of domestic <a name="Page_88"></a>society, and, in a time peculiarly
perilous, lived unmolested and died in quiet.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock I had an appointment with a person unknown. A youth
had written me, demanding an audience. I excused myself by alleging the
want of leisure, and my dislike to communicate with a person perfectly
unknown on unknown business. The application was renewed, and with an
ardour which left me no alternative, so I named eleven this day. I am
too much accustomed to the usual cant of the followers of the muses who
endeavour by flattery to make their bad stale butter make amends for
their stinking fish. I am pretty well acquainted with that sort of
thing. I have had madmen on my hands too, and once nearly was Kotzebued
by a lad of the name of Sharpe. All this gave me some curiosity, but it
was lost in attending to the task I was engaged in; when the door opened
and in walked a young woman of middling rank and rather good address,
but something resembling our secretary David Laing, if dressed in female
habiliments. There was the awkwardness of a moment in endeavouring to
make me understand that she was the visitor to whom I had given the
assignation. Then there were a few tears and sighs. &quot;I fear, Madam, this
relates to some tale of great distress.&quot; &quot;By no means, sir;&quot; and her
countenance cleared up. Still there was a pause; at last she asked if it
were possible for her to see the king. I apprehended then that she was a
little mad, and proceeded to assure her that the king's secretary
received all such applications as were made to his Majesty, and disposed
of them. Then came the mystery. She wished to relieve herself from a
state of bondage, and to be rendered capable of maintaining herself by
acquiring knowledge. I inquired what were her immediate circumstances,
and found she resided with an uncle and aunt. Not thinking the case
without hope, I preached the old doctrine of patience and resignation, I
suppose with the usual effect.</p><a name="Page_89"></a>

<p>Went to the Bannatyne Club; and on the way met Cadell out of breath,
coming to say he had bought the copyrights after a smart contention. Of
this to-morrow. There was little to do at the club.</p>

<p>Afterwards dined with Lord and Lady Abercromby, where I met my old and
kind friend, Major Buchanan of Cambusmore. His father was one of those
from whom I gained much information about the old Highlanders, and at
whose house I spent many merry days in my youth.<a name="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> The last time I saw
old Cambusmore was in&mdash;&mdash;. He sat up an hour later on the occasion,
though then eighty-five. I shall never forget him, and was delighted to
see the Major, who comes seldom to town.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 20.&mdash;Anent the copyrights&mdash;the pock-puds were not frightened
by our high price. They came on briskly, four or five bidders abreast,
and went on till the lot was knocked down to Cadell at &pound;8400; a very
large sum certainly, yet he has been offered profit on it already. For
my part I think the loss would have been very great had we suffered
these copyrights to go from those which we possessed. They would have
been instantly stereotyped and forced on the market to bring home the
price, and by this means depreciated for ever, and all ours must have
shared the same fate. Whereas, husbanded and brought out with care, they
cannot fail to draw in the others in the same series, and thus to be a
sure and respectable source of profit. Considered in this point of view,
even if they were worth only the &pound;8400 to others, they were &pound;10,000 to
us. The largeness of the price arising from the activity of the contest
only serves to show the value of the property.<a name="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> Had at the same time
the agreeable intelligence that the <a name="Page_90"></a>octavo sets, which were bought by
Hurst and Company at a depreciated rate, are now rising in the market,
and that instead of 1500 sold, they have sold upwards of 2000 copies.
This mass will therefore in all probability be worn away in a few months
and then our operations may commence. On the whole, I am greatly pleased
with the acquisition. If this first series be worth &pound;8400, the remaining
books must be worth &pound;10,000, and then there is <i>Napoleon</i>, which is
gliding away daily, for which I would not take the same sum, which would
come to &pound;24,200 in all for copyrights; besides &pound;20,000 payable by
insurance.<a name="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> Add the value of my books and furniture, plate, etc.,
there would be &pound;50,000. So this may be considered my present progress.
There will still remain upwards of &pound;35,000.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Heaven's arm strike with us&mdash;'tis a fearful odds.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet with health and continued popularity there are chances in my favour.</p>

<p>Dine at James Ballantyne's, and happy man is he at the result of the
sale; indeed it must have been the making or marring of him. Sir Henry
Steuart there, who &quot;fooled me to the top of my bent.&quot;</p>

<p><i>December</i> 21.&mdash;A very sweet pretty-looking young lady, the Prima Donna
of the Italian Opera, now performing here, by name Miss Ayton,<a name="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> came
to breakfast this morning, with her father, (a bore, after the manner of
all fathers, mothers, aunts, and other chaperons of pretty actresses)!
Miss Ayton talks very prettily, and, I dare say, sings beautifully,
though too much in the Italian manner, I fear, to be a great favourite
of mine. But I did not hear her, being called away by the Clerk's coach.
I am like Jeremy in <i>Love for Love</i><a name="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>&mdash;have a reasonable good ear for
a jig, but your solos and sonatas give me the spleen.</p>

<p><a name="Page_91"></a>Called at Cadell's, who is still enamoured of his bargain, and with
good reason, as the London booksellers were offering him &pound;1000 or &pound;2000
to give it up to them. He also ascertained that all the copies with
which Hurst and Robinson loaded the market would be off in a half year.
Make us thankful! the weather is clearing to windward. Cadell is
cautious, steady, and hears good counsel; and Gibson quite inclined,
were I too confident, to keep a good look-out ahead.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 22.&mdash;Public affairs look awkward. The present Ministry are
neither Whig nor Tory, and, divested of the support of either of the
great parties of the State, stand supported by the will of the sovereign
alone. This is not constitutional, and though it may be a temporary
augmentation of the sovereign's personal influence, yet it cannot but
prove hurtful to the Crown upon the whole, by tending to throw that
responsibility on the Sovereign of which the law has deprived him. I
pray to God I may be wrong, but an attempt to govern <i>par bascule</i>&mdash;by
trimming betwixt the opposite parties&mdash;is equally unsafe for the crown
and detrimental to the country, and cannot do for a long time. The fact
seems to be that Lord Goderich, a well-meaning and timid man, finds
himself on a precipice&mdash;that his head is grown dizzy and he endeavours
to cling to the person next him. This person is Lord Lansdowne, who he
hopes may support him in the House of Lords against Lord Grey, so he
proposes to bring Lord Lansdowne into the Cabinet. Lord G. resigns, and
his resignation is accepted. Lord Harrowby is then asked to place
himself at the head of a new Administration,&mdash;declines. The tried
abilities of Marquis Wellesley are next applied to; it seems he also
declines, and then Lord Goderich comes back, his point about Lord
Lansdowne having failed, and his threatened resignation goes for
nothing. This must lower the Premier in the eyes of every one. It is
plain the K. will not accept the Whigs; it is equally plain that he <a name="Page_92"></a>has
not made a move towards the Tories, and that with a neutral
administration, this country, hard ruled at anytime, can he long
governed, I, for one, cannot believe. God send the good King, to whom I
owe so much, as safe and honourable extrication as the circumstances
render possible.<a name="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p>After Court Anne set out for Abbotsford with the Miss Kerrs. I came off
at three o'clock to Arniston, where I found Lord Register and lady, R.
Dundas and lady, Robt. Adam Dundas, Durham of Calderwood and lady, old
and young friends. Charles came with me.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 23.&mdash;Went to church to Borthwick with the family, and heard a
well-composed, well-delivered, sensible discourse from Mr. Wright,<a name="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a>
the clergyman&mdash;a different sort of person, I wot, from my old half-mad,
half-drunken, little hump-back acquaintance Clunie,<a name="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> renowned for
singing &quot;The Auld Man's Mear's dead,&quot; and from the circumstance of his
being once interrupted in his minstrelsy by the information that his own
horse had died in the stable.</p>

<p>After sermon we looked at the old castle, which made me an old man. The
castle was not a bit older for the twenty-five years which had passed
away, but the ruins of the visitor were very apparent; to climb up round
stair<a name="Page_93"></a>cases, to creep through vaults and into dungeons, were not the
easy labours but the positive sports of my younger years; but that time
is gone by, and I thought it convenient to attempt no more than the
access to the large and beautiful hall in which, as it is somewhere
described, an armed horseman might brandish his lance. The feeling of
growing and increasing inability is painful to one like me, who boasted,
in spite of my infirmity, great boldness and dexterity in such feats;
the boldness remains, but hand and foot, grip and accuracy of step, have
altogether failed me; the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak, and
so I must retreat into the invalided corps and tell them of my former
exploits, which may very likely pass for lies. We drove to Dalhousie
Castle, where the gallant Earl, who had done so much to distinguish the
British name in all and every quarter of the globe, is repairing the
castle of his ancestors, which of yore stood a siege against John of
Gaunt. I was Lord Dalhousie's companion at school, where he was as much
beloved by his companions as he has been ever respected by his
companions-in-arms, and the people over whom he has been deputed to
exercise the authority of his sovereign. He was always steady, wise, and
generous. The old Castle of Dalhousie&mdash;<i>potius Dalwolsey</i>&mdash;was mangled
by a fellow called, I believe, Douglas, who destroyed, as far as in him
lay, its military and baronial character, and roofed it after the
fashion of a poor-house. The architect, Burn, is now restoring and
repairing in the old taste, and I think creditably to his own feeling.
God bless the roof-tree!</p>

<p>We returned home through the Temple banks by the side of the South Esk,
where I had the pleasure to see that Robert Dundas is laying out his
woods with taste, and managing them with care. His father and uncle took
notice of me when I was a &quot;fellow of no mark or likelihood,&quot; and I am
always happy in finding myself in the old <a name="Page_94"></a>oak room at Arniston, where I
have drunk many a merry bottle, and in the fields where I have seen many
a hare killed.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 24.&mdash;Left Arniston after breakfast and arrived to dinner at
Abbotsford.</p>

<p>My reflections on entering my own gate were of a very different and more
pleasing cast than those with which I left my house about six weeks ago.
I was then in doubt whether I should fly my country or become avowedly
bankrupt, and surrender my library and household furniture, with the
liferent of my estate, to sale. A man of the world will say I had better
done so. No doubt had I taken this course at once, I might have employed
the &pound;25,000 which I made since the insolvency of Constable and
Robinson's houses in compounding my debts. But I could not have slept
sound as I now can, under the comfortable impression of receiving the
thanks of my creditors and the conscious feeling of discharging my duty
like a man of honour and honesty. I see before me a long tedious and
dark path, but it leads to true fame and stainless reputation. If I die
in the harrows, as is very likely, I shall die with honour; if I achieve
my task I shall have the thanks of all concerned, and the approbation of
my own conscience. And so I think I can fairly face the return of
Christmas Day.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 25.&mdash;- I drove over to Huntly Burn, and saw the plantation
which is to be called Janeswood, in honour of my daughter-in-law. All
looking well and in order. Before dinner, arrived Mrs. George Ellis and
her nephew and niece, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Ellis, whom I was delighted
to see, as there are a thousand kind recollections of old days. Mrs.
George Ellis is less changed in manner and appearance than any one I
know. The gay and light-hearted have in that respect superiority over
those who are of a deeper mould and a heavier. There is something even
in the slightness and elasticity of person which outlasts the <a name="Page_95"></a>ponderous
strength which is borne down by its own weight. Colonel Ellis is an
enthusiastic soldier: and, though young, served in Spain and at
Waterloo.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And so we held our Christmastide<br /></span>
<span>With mirth and burly cheer.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>December</i> 26.&mdash;Colonel Ellis and I took a pretty long walk round by the
glen, etc., where I had an extraordinary escape from the breaking down
of a foot-bridge as I put my foot upon it. I luckily escaped either
breaking my leg by its passing through the bridge in so awkward a
manner, or tearing it by some one of the hundred rusty nails through
which it fell. However, I was not, thanks to Heaven, hurt in the
slightest degree. Tom Purdie, who had orders to repair the bridge long
since, was so scandalised at the consequence of his negligence that the
bridge is repaired by the time I am writing this. But how the noiseless
step of Fate dogs us in our most seeming safe and innocent sports.</p>

<p>On returning home we were joined by the Lord Chief-Commissioner, the
Lord Chief Baron, and William Clerk, of gentlemen; and of ladies, Miss
Adam and young Miss Thomson of Charlton. Also the two Miss Kerrs, Lord
Robert's daughters, and so behold us a gallant Christmas party, full of
mirth and harmony. Moreover, Captain John Ferguson came over from Huntly
Burn, so we spent the day jocundly. I intend to take a holiday or two
while these friends are about us. I have worked hard enough to merit it,
and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;... Maggie will not sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i8">For that, ere summer.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>December</i> 27.&mdash;This morning we took a drive up the Yarrow in great
force, and perambulated the Duchess's Walk with all the force of our
company. The weather was delightful, the season being considered; and
Newark <a name="Page_96"></a>Castle, amid its leafless trees, resembled a dear old man who
smiles upon the ruins which time has spread around him. It is looking
more venerable than formerly, for the repairs judiciously undertaken
have now assumed colouring congenial with the old walls; formerly, they
had a raw and patchy appearance. I have seldom seen the scene look
better even when summer smiled upon it.</p>

<p>I have a letter from James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, asking me to
intercede with the Duke of Buccleuch about his farm.<a name="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> He took this
burthen upon himself without the advice of his best friends, and
certainly contrary to mine. From the badness of the times it would have
been a poor speculation in any hands, especially in those of a man of
letters, whose occupation, as well as the society in which it involves
him, [are so different]. But I hope this great family will be kind to
him; if not, <i>cela ne vaudra pas &agrave; moi</i>. But I cannot and ought not to
look for having the same interest with this gentleman which I exercised
in the days of Duke Charles.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 28.&mdash;A demand from Cadell to prepare a revised copy of the
<i>Tales of my Grandfather</i> for the press.<a name="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> I received it with great
pleasure, for I always had private hopes of that work. If I have a knack
for anything it is for selecting the striking and interesting points out
of dull details, and hence, I myself receive so much pleasure and
instruction from volumes which are generally reputed dull and
uninteresting. Give me facts, I will find fancy for myself. The first
two volumes of these little tales are shorter than the third by seventy
or eighty pages. Cadell proposes to equalise them by adding part of vol.
ii. to vol. i., and of <a name="Page_97"></a>vol. iii. to vol. ii. But then vol. i. ends with
the reign of Robert Bruce, vol. ii. with the defeat of Flodden; happy
points of pause which I cannot think of disturbing, the first in
particular, for surely we ought to close one volume at least of Scottish
history at a point which leaves the kingdom triumphant and happy; and,
alas! where do her annals present us with such an era excepting after
Bannockburn? So I will set about to fill up the volumes, which are too
short, with some additional matter, and so diminish at least, if we
cannot altogether remove, their unsightly inequality in size. The rest
of the party went to Dryburgh&mdash;too painful a place of pilgrimage for
me.<a name="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> I walked with the Lord Chief Commissioner through our grounds
at Huntly Burn, and by taking the carriage now and then I succeeded in
giving my excellent old friend enough of exercise without any fatigue.
We made our visit at Huntly Burn.</p>
<a name="Page_98"></a>
<p><i>December</i> 29.&mdash;Lord Chief-Baron, Lord Chief-Commissioner, Miss Adam,
Miss Anstruther Thomson, and William Clerk left us. We read prayers, and
afterwards walked round the terrace.</p>

<p>I had also time to work hard on the additions to the <i>Tales of a
Grandfather</i>, vols. 1 and 2. The day passed pleasantly over.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 30.&mdash;The Fergusons came over, and we welcomed in the New Year
with the usual forms of song and flagon.</p>

<p>Looking back to the conclusion of 1826, I observe that the last year
ended in trouble and sickness, with pressures for the present and gloomy
prospects for the future. The sense of a great privation so lately
sustained, together with the very doubtful and clouded nature of my
private affairs, pressed hard upon my mind. I am now perfectly well in
<a name="Page_99"></a>constitution; and though I am still on troubled waters, yet I am rowing
with the tide, and less than the continuation of my exertions of 1827
may, with God's blessing, carry me successfully through 1828, when we
may gain a more open sea, if not exactly a safe port. Above all, my
children are well. Sophia's situation excites some natural anxiety; but
it is only the accomplishment of the burthen imposed on her sex. Walter
is happy in the view of his majority, on which matter we have favourable
hopes from the Duke of Wellington. Anne is well and happy. Charles's
entry upon life under the highest patronage, and in a line for which I
hope he is qualified, is about to take place presently.</p>

<p>For all these great blessings it becomes me well to be thankful to God,
who in his good time and good pleasure sends us good as well as evil.</p><a name="Page_100"></a><a name="Page_101"></a>

<p><i>January</i> 1.&mdash;Since the 20th November 1825, for two months that is, and
two years, I have kept this custom of a diary. That it has made me wiser
or better I dare not say, but it shows by its progress that I am capable
of keeping a resolution. Perhaps I should not congratulate myself on
this; perhaps it only serves to show I am more a man of method and less
a man of originality, and have no longer that vivacity of fancy that is
inconsistent with regular labour. Still, should this be the case, I
should, having lost the one, be happy to find myself still possessed of
the other.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 2.&mdash;<i>C&aelig;c&aelig; mentes hominum</i>.&mdash;My last entry records my
punctuality in keeping up my diary hitherto; my present labour,
commenced notwithstanding the date, upon the 9th January, is to make up
my little record betwixt the second and that latter date. In a word, I
have been several days in arrear without rhyme or reason,&mdash;days too when
there was so little to write down that the least jotting would have done
it. This must not be in future.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 3.&mdash;Our friends begin to disperse. Mrs. Ellis, who has been
indisposed for the last two days, will I hope bear her journey to London
well. She is the relict of my dear old friend George Ellis,<a name="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> who had
more wit, learning, and knowledge of the world than would fit out twenty
<a name="Page_104"></a><i>literati</i>. The Hardens remained to-day, and I had a long walk with the
laird up the Glen, and so forth. He seemed a little tired, and, with all
due devotion to my Chief, I was not sorry to triumph over some one in
point of activity at my time of day.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 4.&mdash;Visited by Mr. Stewart of Dalguise, who came to collect
materials for a description of Abbotsford, to be given with a drawing in
a large work, <i>Views of Gentlemen's Seats.</i> Mr. Stewart is a
well-informed gentleman-like young man, grave and quiet, yet possessed
of a sense of humour. I must take care he does not in civility over-puff
my little assemblage of curiosities. Scarce anything can be meaner than
the vanity which details the contents of China closets,&mdash;basins, ewers,
and chamberpots. Horace Walpole, with all his talents, makes a silly
figure when he gives an upholsterer's catalogue of his goods and
chattels at Strawberry Hill.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 5.&mdash;This day I began to review Taschereau's <i>Life of Moli&egrave;re</i>
for Mr. Gillies, who is crying help for God's sake. Messrs. Treuttel and
Wurtz offer guerdon. I shall accept, because it is doing Gillies no good
to let him have my labour for nothing, and an article is about &pound;100. In
my pocket it may form a fund to help this poor gentleman or others at a
pinch; in his, I fear it would only encourage a neglect of sober
economy. When in his prosperity he asked me whether there was not, in my
opinion, something interesting in a man of genius being in embarrassed
circumstances. God knows he has had enough of them since, poor fellow;
and it should be remembered that if he thus dallied with his good
fortune, his benevolence to others was boundless.</p>

<p>We had the agreeable intelligence of Sophia being safely delivered of a
girl; the mother and child doing well. Praised be God!</p>

<p><i>January</i> 6.&mdash;I have a letter from the Duke of Wellington, making no
promises, but assuring me of a favourable con<a name="Page_105"></a>sideration of Walter's
case, should an opening occur for the majority. This same <i>step</i> is
represented as the most important, but so in their time were the
lieutenancy and the troop. Each in its turn was <i>the</i> step <i>par
excellence</i>. It appears that these same steps are those of a treadmill,
where the party is always ascending and never gains the top. But the
same simile would suit most pursuits in life.</p>

<p>The Misses Kerr left us on Friday&mdash;two charming young persons,
well-looked, well-mannered, and well-born; above all, well-principled.
They sing together in a very delightful manner, and our evenings are the
duller without them.</p>

<p>I am annoyed beyond measure with the idle intrusion of voluntary
correspondents; each man who has a pen, ink, and sheet of foolscap to
spare, flies a letter at me. I believe the postage costs me &pound;100 [a
year], besides innumerable franks; and all the letters regard the
writer's own hopes or projects, or are filled with unasked advice or
extravagant requests. I think this evil increases rather than
diminishes. On the other hand, I must fairly own that I have received
many communications in this way worth all the trouble and expense that
the others cost me, so I must &quot;lay the head of the sow to the tail of
the grice,&quot; as the proverb elegantly expresses itself.</p>

<p>News again of Sophia and baby. Mrs. Hughes thinks the infant a beauty.
Johnnie opines that it is not <i>very</i> pretty, and grandpapa supposes it
to be like other new-born children, which are as like as a basket of
oranges.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 7.&mdash;Wrought at the review, and finished a good lot of it. Mr.
Stewart left us, amply provided with the history of Abbotsford and its
contents. It is a kind of Conundrum Castle to be sure, and I have great
pleasure in it, for while it pleases a fantastic person in the style and
manner of its architecture and decoration, it has all the comforts of a
commodious habitation.</p>

<p>Besides the review, I have been for this week busily employed in
revising for the press the <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>.<a name="Page_106"></a> Cadell rather
wished to rush it out by employing three different presses, but this <i>I
repressed</i> (smoke the pun!). I will not have poor James Ballantyne
driven off the plank to which we are all three clinging.<a name="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> I have
made great additions to volume first, and several of these <i>Tales</i>; and
I care not who knows it, I think well of them. Nay, I will hash history
with anybody, be he who he will.<a name="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> I do not know but it would be wise
to let romantic composition rest, and turn my mind to the history of
England, France, and Ireland, to be <i>da capo rota'd,</i> as well as that of
Scotland. Men would laugh at me as an author for Mr. Newbery's shop in
Paul's Churchyard. I should care little for that. <i>Virginibus
puerisque.</i> I would as soon compose histories for boys and girls, which
may be useful, as fictions for children of a larger growth, which can at
best be only idle folk's entertainment. But write what I will, or to
whom I will, I am doggedly determined to write myself out of the present
scrape by any labour that is fair and honest.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 8.&mdash;Despatched my review (in part), and in the morning walked
from Chiefswood, all about the shearing flats, and home by the new walk,
which I have called the Bride's Walk, because Jane was nearly stuck fast
in the bog there, just after her marriage, in the beginning of 1825.</p>
<a name="Page_107"></a>
<p>My post brings serious intelligence to-day, and of a very pleasing
description. Longman and Company, with a reserve which marks all their
proceedings, suddenly inform Mr. Gibson that they desire 1000 of the 8vo
edition of <i>St. Ronan's Well,</i> and the subsequent series of Novels
thereunto belonging, for that they have only <i>seven</i> remaining, and wish
it to be sent to their printers, and pushed out in three months. Thus
this great house, without giving any previous notice of the state of the
sale, expect all to be boot and saddle, horse and away, whenever they
give the signal. In the present case this may do, because I will make
neither alteration nor addition till our grand <i>opus</i>, the Improved
Edition, goes to press. But ought we to go to press with this 1000
copies knowing that our project will supersede and render equivalent to
waste paper such of them as may not reach the public before our plan is
publicly known and begins to operate? I have, I acknowledge, doubt as to
this. No doubt I feel perfectly justified in letting Longman and Co.
look to their own interest, since they have neither consulted me nor
attended to mine. But the loss might extend to the retail booksellers;
and to hurt the men through whom my works are ultimately to find their
way to the public would be both unjust and impolitic. On the contrary,
if the <i>St. Ronan</i> Series be hurried out immediately, there is time
enough perhaps to sell it off before the Improved Edition appears. In
the meantime it appears that the popularity of these works is increasing
rather than diminishing, that the measure of securing the copyrights was
most judicious, and that, with proper management, things will work
themselves round. Successful first editions are good, but they require
exertion and imply fresh risk of reputation. But repeated editions tell
only to the agreeable part of literature.<a name="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_108"></a>
<p>Longman and Company have also at length opened their oracular jaws on
the subject of <i>Bonaparte</i>, and acknowledged its rapid sale, and the
probable exhaustion of the present edition.</p>

<p>These tidings, with the success of the <i>Tales</i>, &quot;speak of Africa and
golden joys.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> But the tidings arriving after dinner rather
discomposed me. In the evening I wrote to Cadell and Ballantyne at
length, proposing a meeting at my house on Tuesday first, to hold a
privy council.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 9.&mdash;My first reflection was on Napoleon. I will not be hurried
in my corrections of that work; and that I may not be so, I will begin
them the instant that I have finished the review. It makes me tremble to
think of the mass of letters I have to look through in order to select
all those which affect the subject of <i>Napoleon</i>, and which, in spite of
numerous excellent resolutions, I have never separated from the common
file from which they are now to be selected. Confound them! but they
<i>are</i> confounded already. Indolence is a delightful indulgence, but at
what a rate we <a name="Page_109"></a>purchase it! To-day we go to Mertoun, and having spent
some time in making up my Journal to this length, and in a chat with
Captain John, who dropped in, I will presently set to the review&mdash;knock
it off, if possible, before we start at five o'clock. To-morrow, when I
return, we will begin the disagreeable task of a thorough rummage of
papers, books, and documents. My character as a man of letters, and as a
man of honour, depends on my making that work as correct as possible. It
has succeeded, notwithstanding every effort here and in France<a name="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> to
put it down, and it shall not lose ground for want of backing. We went
to dine and pass the night at Mertoun, where we met Sir John Pringle,
Mr. and Mrs. Baillie Mellerstain, and their daughters.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 10.&mdash;When I rose this morning the weather was changed and the
ground covered with snow. I am sure it's winter fairly. We returned from
Mertoun after breakfast through an incipient snowstorm, coming on
partially, and in great flakes, the sun bursting at intervals through
the clouds. At last <i>Die Wolken laufen zusammen</i>. We made a slow journey
of it through the swollen river and heavy roads, but here we are at
last.</p>

<p>I am rather sorry we expect friends to-day, though these friends be the
good Fergusons. I have a humour for work, to which the sober, sad
uniformity of a snowy day always particularly disposes me, and I am sure
I will get poor Gillies off my hand, at least if I had morning and
evening. Then I would set to work with arranging everything for these
second editions of <i>Napoleon, The Romances</i>, etc., which must be soon
got afloat. I must say &quot;the wark gangs <a name="Page_110"></a>bonnily on.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> Well, I will
ring for coals, mend my pen, and try what can be done.</p>

<p>I wrought accordingly on Gillies's review for the <i>Life of Moli&egrave;re</i>, a
gallant subject. I am only sorry I have not time to do it justice. It
would have required a complete re-perusal of his works, for which, alas!
I have no leisure.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;For long, though pleasant, is the way,<br /></span>
<span>And life, alas! allows but one ill winter's day.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Which is too literally my own case.</p>
<br />

<p><i>January</i> 11.&mdash;Renewed my labour, finished the review, <i>talis qualis</i>,
and sent it off. Commenced then my infernal work of putting to rights.
Much cry and little woo', as the deil said when he shore the sow. But I
have detected one or two things that had escaped me, and may do more
to-morrow. I observe by a letter from Mr. Cadell that I had somewhat
misunderstood his last. It is he, not Longman, that wishes to publish
the thousand copies of <i>St. Ronan's</i> Series, and there is no immediate
call for <i>Napoleon</i>. This makes little difference in my computation. The
pressing necessity of correction is put off for two or three months
probably, and I have time to turn myself to the <i>Chronicles</i>. I do not
much like the task, but when did I ever like labour of any kind? My
hands were fully occupied to-day with writing letters and adjusting
papers&mdash;both a great bore.</p>

<p>The news from London assure a change of Ministry. The old Tories come in
play. But I hope they will compromise nothing. There is little danger
since Wellington takes the lead.</p>
<br />

<p><i>January</i> 12.&mdash;My expenses have been considerably more than I expected;
but I think that, having done so <a name="Page_111"></a>much, I need not undergo the
mortification of giving up Abbotsford and parting with my old habits and
servants.<a name="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>
<br />

<p><i>January</i> 13, <i>[Edinburgh].</i>&mdash;We had a slow and tiresome retreat from
Abbotsford through the worst of weather, half-sleet, half-snow. Dined
with the Royal Society Club, and, being an anniversary, sat till nine
o'clock, instead of half-past seven.</p>
<br />

<p><i>January</i> 14.&mdash;I read Cooper's new novel, <i>The Red Rover</i>; the current
of it rolls entirely upon the ocean. Something there is too much of
nautical language; in fact, it overpowers everything else. But, so
people once take an interest in a description, they will swallow a great
deal which they do not understand. The sweet word &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; has its
charm in other compositions as well as in sermons. He has much genius, a
powerful conception of character, and force of execution. The same
ideas, I see, recur upon him that haunt other folks. The graceful form
of the spars, and the tracery of the ropes and cordage against the sky,
is too often dwelt upon.</p>
<br />

<p><i>January</i> 15.&mdash;This day the Court sat down. I missed my good friend
Colin Mackenzie, who proposes to retire, from indifferent health. A
better man never lived&mdash;eager to serve every one&mdash;a safeguard over all
public business which came through his hands. As Deputy-Keeper of the
Signet he will be much missed. He had a patience in listening to every
one which is of the [highest consequence] in the management of a public
body; for many men care less to gain their point than they do to play
the orator, and be listened to for a certain time. This done, and due
<a name="Page_112"></a>quantity of personal consideration being gained, the individual orator
is usually satisfied with the reasons of the civil listener, who has
suffered him to enjoy his hour of consequence. I attended the Court, but
there was very little for me to do. The snowy weather has annoyed my
fingers with chilblains, and I have a threatening of rheumatism&mdash;which
Heaven avert!</p>

<p>James Ballantyne and Mr. Cadell dined with me to-day and talked me into
a good humour with my present task, which I had laid aside in disgust.
It must, however, be done, though I am loth to begin to it again.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 16.&mdash;Again returned early, and found my way home with some
difficulty. The weather&mdash;a black frost powdered with snow, my fingers
suffering much and my knee very stiff. When I came home, I set to work,
but not to the <i>Chronicles</i>. I found a less harassing occupation in
correcting a volume or two of <i>Napoleon</i> in a rough way. My indolence,
if I can call it so, is of a capricious kind. It never makes me
absolutely idle, but very often inclines me&mdash;as it were from mere
contradiction's sake&mdash;to exchange the task of the day for something
which I am not obliged to do at the moment, or perhaps not at all.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 17.&mdash;My knee so swelled and the weather so cold that I stayed
from Court. I nibbled for an hour or two at <i>Napoleon</i>, then took
handsomely to my gear, and wrote with great ease and fluency six pages
of the <i>Chronicles</i>. If they are but tolerable I shall be satisfied. In
fact, such as they are, they must do, for I shall get warm as I work, as
has happened on former occasions. The fact is, I scarce know what is to
succeed or not; but this is the consequence of writing too much and too
often. I must get some breathing space. But how is that to be managed?
There is the rub.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 18-19.&mdash;Remained still at home, and wrought hard. The fountain
trickles free enough, but God knows <a name="Page_113"></a>whether the waters will be worth
drinking. However, I have finished a good deal of hard work,&mdash;that's the
humour of it.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 20.&mdash;Wrought hard in the forenoon. At dinner we had Helen
Erskine,&mdash;whom circumstances lead to go to India in search of the
domestic affection which she cannot find here,&mdash;Mrs. George Swinton, and
two young strangers: one, a son of my old friend Dr. Stoddart of the
<i>Times</i>, a well-mannered and intelligent youth, the other that unnatural
character, a tame Irishman, resembling a formal Englishman.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 21.&mdash;This morning I sent J.B. as far as page forty-three,
being fully two-thirds of the volume. The rest I will drive on, trusting
that, contrary to the liberated posthorse in John Gilpin, the lumber of
the wheels rattling behind me may put spirit in the poor brute who has
to drag it.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Moscheles were here at breakfast. She is a very pretty
little Jewess; he one of the greatest performers on the pianoforte of
the day,&mdash;certainly most surprising and, what I rather did not expect,
pleasing.</p>

<p>I have this day the melancholy news of Glengarry's death, and was
greatly shocked. The eccentric parts of his character, the pretensions
which he supported with violence and assumption of rank and authority,
were obvious subjects of censure and ridicule, which in some points were
not undeserved. He played the part of a chieftain too nigh the life to
be popular among an altered race, with whom he thought, felt, and acted,
I may say in right and wrong, as a chieftain of a hundred years since
would have done, while his conduct was viewed entirely by modern eyes,
and tried by modern rules.<a name="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>January</i> 22.&mdash;I am, I find, in serious danger of losing the habit of my
Journal; and, having carried it on so long, that would be pity. But I am
now, on the 1st February, fishing for the lost recollections of the days
since the 21st January. <a name="Page_114"></a>Luckily there is not very much to remember or
forget, and perhaps the best way would be to skip and go on.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 23.&mdash;Being a Teind day, I had a good opportunity of work. I
should have said I had given breakfast on the 21st to Mr. and Mrs.
Moscheles; she a beautiful young creature, &quot;and one that adores me,&quot; as
Sir Toby says,<a name="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>&mdash;that is, in my poetical capacity;&mdash;in fact, a frank
and amiable young person. I liked Mr. Moscheles' playing better than I
could have expected, considering my own bad ear. But perhaps I flatter
myself, and think I understood it better than I did. Perhaps I have not
done myself justice, and know more of music than I thought I did. But it
seems to me that his variations have a more decided style of originality
than those I have commonly heard, which have all the signs of a <i>da capo
rota</i>.</p>

<p>Dined at Sir Archibald Campbell's,<a name="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> and drank rather more wine than
usual in a sober way. To be sure, it was excellent, and some old
acquaintances proved a good excuse for the glass.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 24.&mdash;I took a perverse fit to-day, and went off to write
notes, et cetera, on <i>Guy Mannering</i>. This was perverse enough; but it
was a composition between humour and duty; and as such, let it pass.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 25.&mdash;I went on working, sometimes at my legitimate labours,
sometimes at my jobs of Notes, but still working faithfully, in good
spirits, and contented.</p>

<p>Huntly Gordon has disposed of the two sermons<a name="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> to the bookseller
Colburn for &pound;250&mdash;well sold, I think&mdash;and is to go forth immediately.
The man is a puffing quack; but though I would rather the thing had not
gone there, and far rather that it had gone nowhere, yet, hang it! if it
makes the <a name="Page_115"></a>poor lad easy, what needs I fret about it? After all, there
would be little gain in doing a kind thing, if you did not suffer pain
or inconvenience upon the score.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 26.&mdash;Being Saturday, attended Mr. Moscheles' concert, and was
amused; the more so that I had Mrs. M. herself to flirt a little with.
To have so much beauty as she really possesses, and to be accomplished
and well-read, she is an unaffected and pleasant person. Mr. Moscheles
gives lessons at two guineas by the hour, and he has actually found
scholars in this poor country. One of them at least (Mrs. John Murray)
may derive advantage from his instructions; for I observe his mode of
fingering is very peculiar, as he seems to me to employ the fingers of
the same hand in playing the melody and managing the bass at the same
time, which is surely most uncommon.</p>

<p>I presided at the Celtic Society's dinner to-day, and proposed
Glengarry's memory, which, although there had been a rough dispute with
the Celts and the poor Chief, was very well received. I like to see men
think and bear themselves like men. There were fewer in the tartan than
usual&mdash;which was wrong.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 27.&mdash;Wrought manfully at the <i>Chronicles</i> all this day and
have nothing to jot down; only I forgot that I lost my lawsuit some day
last week or the week before. The fellow therefore gets his money, plack
and bawbee, but it's always a troublesome claim settled,<a name="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> and there
can be no other of the same kind, as every other creditor has accepted
the composition of <i>7s.</i> in the &pound;, which my exertions have enabled me to
pay them. About &pound;20,000 of the fund had been created by my own exertions
since the bankruptcy took place, and I had a letter from Donald Horne,
by commission of the creditors, to express their sense of my exertions
in their behalf. All this is consolatory.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 28.&mdash;I am in the scrape of sitting for my picture, and had to
repair for two hours to-day to Mr. Colvin <a name="Page_116"></a>Smith&mdash;Lord Gillies's nephew.
The Chief Baron<a name="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> had the kindness to sit with me great part of the
time, as the Chief Commissioner had done on a late occasion. The picture
is for the Chief Commissioner, and the Chief Baron desires a copy. I
trust it will he a good one. At home in the evening, and wrote. I am
well on before the press, notwithstanding late hours, lassitude, and
laziness. I have read Cooper's <i>Prairie</i>&mdash;better, I think, than his <i>Red
Rover</i>, in which you never get foot on shore, and to understand entirely
the incidents of the story it requires too much knowledge of nautical
language. It's very clever, though.<a name="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>January</i> 29.&mdash;This day at the Court, and wrote letters at home, besides
making a visit or two&mdash;rare things with me. I have an invitation from
Messrs Saunders and Otley, booksellers, offering me from &pound;1500 to &pound;2000
annually to conduct a journal; but I am their humble servant. I am too
indolent to stand to that sort of work, and I must preserve the
undisturbed use of my leisure, and possess my soul in quiet. A large
income is not my object; I must clear my debts; and that is to be done
by writing things of which I can retain the property. Made my excuses
accordingly.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 30.&mdash;After Court hours I had a visit from Mr. Charles Heath,
the engraver, accompanied by a son of Reynolds the dramatist. His object
was to engage me to take charge as editor of a yearly publication called
<i>The Keepsake,</i> of which the plates are beyond comparison beautiful, but
the letter-press indifferent enough. He proposed &pound;800 a year if I would
become editor, and &pound;400 if I would contribute from seventy to one
hundred pages. I declined both, but told him I might give him some
trifling <a name="Page_117"></a>thing or other, and asked the young men to breakfast the next
day. Worked away in the evening and completed, &quot;in a way and in a
manner,&quot; the notes on <i>Guy Mannering</i>. The first volume of the
<i>Chronicles</i> is now in Ballantyne's hands, all but a leaf or two. Am I
satisfied with my exertions? So so. Will the public be pleased with
them? Umph! I doubt the bubble will burst. While it is current, however,
it is clear I should stand by it. Each novel of three volumes brings
&pound;4000, and I remain proprietor of the mine when the first ore is cropped
out. This promises a good harvest, from what we have experienced. Now,
to become a stipendiary editor of a New-Year's Gift-Book is not to be
thought of, nor could I agree to work for any quantity of supply to such
a publication. Even the pecuniary view is not flattering, though these
gentlemen meant it should be so. But one hundred of their close-printed
pages, for which they offer &pound;400, is not nearly equal to one volume of a
novel, for which I get &pound;1300, and have the reversion of the copyright.
No, I may give them a trifle for nothing, or sell them an article for a
round price, but no permanent engagement will I make. Being the
Martyrdom, there was no Court. I wrought away with what appetite I
could.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 31.&mdash;I received the young gentlemen to breakfast and expressed
my resolution, which seemed to disappoint them, as perhaps they expected
I should have been glad of such an offer. However, I have since thought
there are these rejected parts of the <i>Chronicles</i>, which Cadell and
Ballantyne criticised so severely, which might well enough make up a
trifle of this kind, and settle the few accounts which, will I nill I,
have crept in this New Year. So I have kept the treaty open. If I give
them 100 pages I should expect &pound;500.</p>

<p>I was late at the Court and had little time to write any till after
dinner, and then was not in the vein; so commentated.</p><a name="Page_118"></a>

<a name="FEBRUARY_1828"></a><h2>FEBRUARY.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>February</i> 1.&mdash;I had my two youths again to breakfast, but I did not say
more about my determination, save that I would help them if I could make
it convenient. The Chief Commissioner has agreed to let Heath have his
pretty picture of a Study at Abbotsford, by Edwin Landseer, in which old
Maida occurs. The youth Reynolds is what one would suppose his father's
son to be, smart and forward, and knows the world. I suppose I was too
much fagged with sitting in the Court to-day to write hard after dinner,
but I did work, however.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 2.&mdash;Corrected proofs, which are now nearly up with me. This
day was an idle one, for I remained in Court till one, and sat for my
picture till half-past three to Mr. Smith. He has all the steadiness and
sense in appearance which his cousin R.P.G. lacks.<a name="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> Whether he has
genius or no, I am no judge. My own portrait is like, but I think too
broad about the jowls, a fault which they all fall into, as I suppose,
by placing their subject upon a high stage and looking upwards to them,
which must foreshorten the face. The Chief Baron and Chief Commissioner
had the goodness to sit with me.</p>

<p>Dressed and went with Anne to dine at Pinkie House, where I met the
President,<a name="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> Lady Charlotte, etc.; above all, Mrs. Scott of Gala,
whom I had not seen for some time. We had much fun, and I was, as Sir
Andrew Aguecheek <a name="Page_119"></a>says, in good fooling.<a name="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> A lively French girl, a
governess I think, but very pretty and animated, seemed much amused with
the old gentleman. Home at eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>By the by, Sir John Hope had found a Roman eagle on his estate in Fife
with sundry of those pots and coffeepots, so to speak, which are so
common: but the eagle was mislaid, so I did not see it.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 3.&mdash;I corrected proofs and wrote this morning,&mdash;but slowly,
heavily, lazily. There was a mist on my mind which my exertions could
not dispel. I did not get two pages finished, but I corrected proofs and
commentated.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 4.&mdash;Wrote a little and was obliged to correct the Moli&egrave;re
affair for R.P.G. I think his plan cannot go on much longer with so much
weakness at the helm. A clever fellow would make it take the field with
a vengeance, but poor G. will run in debt with the booksellers and let
all go to the devil. I sent a long letter to Lockhart, received from
Horace Smith, very gentlemanlike and well-written, complaining that Mr.
Leigh Hunt had mixed him up, in his Life of Byron, with Shelley as if he
had shared his irreligious opinions. Leigh Hunt afterwards at the
request of Smith published a swaggering contradiction of the inference
to be derived from the way in which he has named them together. Horatio
Smith seems not to have relied upon his disclamation, as he has
requested me to mention the thing to John Lockhart, and to some one
influential about Ebony, which I have done accordingly.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 5.&mdash;Concluded the first volume before breakfast. I am but
indifferently pleased; either the kind of thing is worn out, or I am
worn out myself, or, lastly, I am stupid for the time. The book must be
finished, however. Cadell is greatly pleased with annotations intended
for the new edition of the Waverley series. I believe that work must be
soon sent to press, which would put a powerful wheel in <a name="Page_120"></a>motion to clear
the ship. I went to the Parliament House, and in return strolled into
Cadell's, being rather anxious to prolong my walk, for I fear the
constant sitting for so many hours. When I returned, the Duke of
Buccleuch came in. He is looking very well, and stout, but melancholy
about his sister, Lady Charlotte Stopford. He is fitting up a part of
Bowhill and intends to shoot there this year. God send him life and
health, for it is of immense consequence.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 6.&mdash;This and visits wasted my time till past two, and then I
slept half-an-hour from mere exhaustion. Went in the evening to the
play, and saw that good old thing, an English tragedy, well got up. It
was <i>Venice Preserved</i>. Mrs. H. Siddons played Belvidera with much
truth, feeling, and tenderness, though short of her mother-in-law's
uncommon majesty, which is a thing never to be forgotten. Mr. Young
played Pierre very well, and a good Jaffier was supplied by a Mr.
Vandenhoff. And so the day glided by; only three pages written, which,
however, is a fair task.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 7.&mdash;It was a Teind day, so no Court, but very little work. I
wrote this morning till the boy made his appearance for proofs; then I
had letters to write. Item, at five o'clock I set out with Charles for
Dalkeith to present him to the young Duke.</p>

<p>I asked the Duke about poor Hogg. I think he has decided to take Mr.
Riddell's opinion; it is unlucky the poor fellow has ever taken that
large and dear farm.<a name="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> Altogether Dalkeith was melancholy to-night,
and I could not raise my spirits at all.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 8.&mdash;I had a little work before dinner, but we are only seven
pages into volume second. It is always a beginning, however; perhaps not
a good one&mdash;I cannot tell. I went out to call on Gala and Jack
Rutherfurd of Edgerstoun; saw the former, not the latter. Gala is
getting much better. He talked as if the increase of his village was
like to <a name="Page_121"></a>drive him over the hill to the Abbotsford side, which would
greatly beautify that side and certainly change his residence for the
better, only that he must remain some time without any appearance of
plantation. The view would be enchanting.</p>

<p>I was tempted to buy a picture of Nell Gywnne,<a name="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> which I think has
merit; at least it pleases me. Seven or eight years ago Graham of
Gartmore bid for it against me, and I gave it up at twenty-five guineas.
I have now bought it for &pound;18, 18s. Perhaps there was folly in this, but
I reckoned it a token of good luck that I should succeed in a wish I had
formerly harboured in vain. I love marks of good luck even in trifles.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 9.&mdash;Sent off three leaves of copy; this is using the press
like the famished sailor who was fed by a comrade with shell-fish by one
at a time. But better anything than stop, for the devil is to get set
a-going again. I know no more than my old boots whether I am right or
wrong, but have no very favourable anticipations.</p>

<p>As I came home from the Court about twelve I stepped into the
Exhibition. It makes a very good show; the portraits are better than
last year, those of Colvin Smith and Watson Gordon especially improve.
Landseer's Study at Abbotsford is in a capital light, and generally
admired. I particularly distinguished John Thomson's picture of
Turnberry, which is of first-rate excellence. A picture by Scrope was
also generally distinguished. It is a view in Calabria.</p>

<p>There is a rival Exhibition which does not hurt the earlier foundation,
but rather excites emulation. I am told there are good paintings there.
I came home with little good-will to work, but I will compel myself to
do something. Unluckily, I have again to go out to dinner to-day, being
President of the Bannatyne.</p>

<p>The dinner was a pleasant one; about thirty members <a name="Page_122"></a>attended. I kept
the chair till near eleven, and the company were very joyous.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 10.&mdash;I set myself doggedly to work, and turned off six leaves
before dinner. Had to dinner Sir John Pringle, my dear Gala and his
lady, and young Mackenzie and Miss Jardine. I was quite pleased to see
Gala so well recovered of the consequences of his frightful fall, which
hung about him so long. He is one of the kindest and best-informed men
whom I know.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 11.&mdash;I had Charles Young<a name="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> to breakfast with us, who gave
us some striking anecdotes of Talma during the Reign of Terror, which
may figure in <i>Napoleon</i> to great advantage.</p>

<p>My son Charles left us this morning to take possession of his situation
in the Foreign Office. He has been very lucky. Correcting sheets, etc.,
took up the morning hours. I wrote three leaves before two o'clock. Day
bitter cold&mdash;with snow, a strong contrast to the mild weather we had
last week.</p>

<p>Salutation of two old Scottish lairds:&mdash;&quot;Ye're maist obedient hummil
servant, Tannachy Tulloh.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Your nain man, Kilspindie.&quot;</p>

<p>Finished six pages, twenty-five pages of print that is, or about the
thirteenth part of a volume. That would be a volume in a fortnight, with
a holiday to boot. It would be possible enough for a little while.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 12.&mdash;I wrought hard this morning. Ballantyne blames the
Ossianic monotony of my principal characters. Now they are not Ossianic.
The language of the Ossianic poetry is highly figurative; that of the
knights of chivalry may be monotonous, and probably is, but it cannot be
Ossianic. Sooth to say, this species of romance of chivalry <a name="Page_123"></a>is an
exhaustible subject. It affords materials for splendid description for
once or twice, but they are too unnatural and formal to bear repetition.
We must go on with our present work, however, <i>valeat quantum</i>. Mr.
Cadell, less critical than J.B., seems pleased. The world will soon
decide if I get on at this rate; for I have finished four leaves to-day,
notwithstanding my attendance on the Court.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 13.&mdash;Mr. Macintosh Mackay, minister of Laggan, breakfasted
with us this morning. This reverend gentleman is completing the Highland
Dictionary,<a name="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> and seems very competent for the task. He left in my
hands some papers of Cluny Macpherson, concerning the affair of 1745,
from which I have extracted an account of the battle of Clifton for
<i>Waverley</i>. He has few prejudices (for a Highlander), and is a mild,
well-mannered young man. We had much talk on Highland matters.</p>

<p>The Children's Tales continue in demand. Cadell expects a new edition of
10,000 about next year, which may be &pound;750 or &pound;800 in pouch, besides
constituting a fine property.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 14.&mdash;Mr. Edwards, a candidate for the situation of Rector in
the Edinburgh Academy, a pleasant, gentlemanlike man, and recommended
highly for experience and learning; but he is himself afraid of wanting
bodily strength for the work, which requires all the nerve and muscle of
Williams. I wish he had been three inches taller, and stout in
proportion. I went to Mr. John Russell's, where there was an Academical
party at dinner. Home at nine, a cigar, and to bed.</p>

<p><a name="Page_124"></a><i>February</i> 15.&mdash;Rose this morning about seven and wrote at the desk
till breakfast; finished about a page and a half. I was fagged at Court
till near two. Then called on Cadell, and so home, tired enough.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 16.&mdash;There dined with me to-day Tom Thomson, Will Clerk, Mr.
Edwards, and my Celtic friend Mr. Mackay of Laggan.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 17.&mdash;A day of hard work, being I think eight pages<a name="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a>
before dinner. I cannot, I am sure, tell if it is worth marking down,
that yesterday at dinner-time I was strangely haunted by what I would
call the sense of pre-existence,&mdash;videlicet, a confused idea that
nothing that passed was said for the first time, that the same topics
had been discussed, and the same persons had stated the same opinions on
the same subjects. It is true there might have been some ground for
recollections, considering that three at least of the company were old
friends, and kept much company together: that is, Justice-Clerk,<a name="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a>
[Lord] Abercromby, and I. But the sensation was so strong as to resemble
what is called a <i>mirage</i> in the desert, or a calenture on board ship,
when lakes are seen in the desert, and silvan landscapes in the sea. It
was very distressing yesterday, and brought to my mind the fancies of
Bishop Berkeley about an ideal world. There was a vile sense of want of
reality in all I did and said. It made me gloomy and out of spirits,
though I flatter myself it was not observed. The bodily feeling which
most resembles this unpleasing hallucination is the giddy state which
follows profuse bleeding, when one feels as if walking on feather-beds
and could not find a secure footing. I think the stomach has something
to do with it. I drank several glasses of wine, but these only augmented
the disorder. I did not find the <i>in vino veritas</i> of the philosophers.
Something of this insane feeling remains to-day, but a trifle only.</p>

<p><a name="Page_125"></a><i>February</i> 18.&mdash;I had other work to do this day. In the morning
corrected proofs. After breakfast, made a visit or two, and met Sandie
Buchanan, whom it joys me to see. Then despatched all my sheriff
processes, save one, which hitches for want of some papers. Lastly, here
I am, before dinner, with my journal. I sent all the county money to
Andrew Lang. Wrote to Mr. Reynolds too; methinks I will let them have
the Tales which Jem Ballantyne and Cadell quarrelled with.<a name="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> I have
asked &pound;500 for them&mdash;pretty well that. I suppose they will be fools
enough to give it me. In troth she'll no pe cheaper.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 19.&mdash;A day of hard and continued work, the result being eight
pages. But then I hardly ever quitted the table save at meal-time. So
eight pages of my manuscript may be accounted the maximum of my literary
labour. It is equal to forty printed pages of the novels. I had the
whole of this day at my own disposal, by the voluntary kindness of Sir
Robert Dundas interfering to take up my duty at the Court. The proofs of
my Sermons are arrived, but I have had no time, saving to blot out some
flummery, which poor Gordon had put into the preface.<a name="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>February</i> 20.&mdash;Another day of labour; but not so hard. I worked from
eight till three with little intermission, but only accomplished four
pages. Then I went out and made a visit or two, and looked in on Cadell.
If I get two pages in the evening I will be satisfied, for volume II.
may be concluded with the week, or run over to Sunday at most. Will it
tell, this work? I doubt it, but there is no standing still.</p>

<p>A certain Mr. Mackay from Ireland called on me, an active agent, it
would seem, about the reform of prisons. He exclaims, justly I have no
doubt, about the state of our Lock-up House. For myself, I have some
distrust of the fanaticism&mdash;even of philanthropy. A good part of it
arises <a name="Page_126"></a>in general from mere vanity and love of distinction, gilded over
to others and to themselves with some show of benevolent sentiment. The
philanthropy of Howard, mingled with his ill-usage of his son, seems to
have risen to a pitch of insanity. Yet without such extraordinary men,
who call attention to the subject by their own peculiarities, prisons
would have remained the same dungeons which they were forty or fifty
years ago. I do not see the propriety of making them dandy places of
detention. They should be a place of punishment, and that can hardly be
if men are lodged better, and fed better, than when they are at large.
The separation of ranks is an excellent distinction, and is nominally
provided for in all modern prisons. But the size of most of them is
inadequate to the great increase of crime, and so the pack is shuffled
together again for want of room to keep them separate. There are several
prisons constructed on excellent principles, the economy of which
becomes deranged so soon as the death takes place of some keen
philanthropist who had the business of a whole committee, which, having
lost him, remained like a carcass without a head. But I have never seen
a plan for keeping in order these resorts of guilt and misery, without
presupposing a superintendence of a kind which might perhaps be
exercised, could we turn out upon the watch a guard of angels. But,
alas! jailors and turnkeys are rather like angels of a different livery,
nor do I see how it is possible to render them otherwise.
Superintendence is all you can trust to, and superintendence, save in
some rare cases, is hard to come by, where it is to be vigilantly and
constantly exercised. <i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i> As to
reformation, I have no great belief in it, when the ordinary class of
culprits, who are vicious from ignorance or habit, are the subjects of
the experiment. &quot;A shave from a broken loaf&quot; is thought as little of by
the male set of delinquents as by the fair frail. The state of <a name="Page_127"></a>society
now leads so much to great accumulations of humanity, that we cannot
wonder if it ferment and reek like a compost dunghill. Nature intended
that population should be diffused over the soil in proportion to its
extent. We have accumulated in huge cities and smothering manufactories
the numbers which should be spread over the face of a country; and what
wonder that they should be corrupted? We have turned healthful and
pleasant brooks into morasses and pestiferous lakes,&mdash;what wonder the
soil should be unhealthy? A great deal, I think, might be done by
executing the punishment of <i>death</i>, without a chance of escape, in all
cases to which it should be found properly applicable; of course these
occasions being diminished to one out of twenty to which capital
punishment is now assigned. Our ancestors brought the country to order
by kilting<a name="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> thieves and banditti with strings. So did the French
when at Naples, and bandits became for the time unheard of. When once
the evil habit is altered&mdash;when men are taught a crime of a certain
character is connected inseparably with death, the moral habits of a
population become altered, and you may in the next age remit the
punishment which in this it has been necessary to inflict with stern
severity. I think whoever pretends to reform a corrupted nation, or a
disorderly regiment, or an ill-ordered ship of war, must begin by
severity, and only resort to gentleness when he has acquired the
complete mastery by terror&mdash;the terror being always attached to the law;
and, the impression once made, he can afford to govern with mildness,
and lay the iron rule aside.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackay talked big of the excellent state of prisons in Ireland.
<i>J'en doute un peu.</i> That the warm-hearted and generous Irish would
hurry eagerly into any scheme which <a name="Page_128"></a>had benevolence for its motive, I
readily believe; but that Pat should have been able to maintain that
calm, all-seeing, all-enduring species of superintendence necessary to
direct the working of the best plan of prison discipline, I greatly
hesitate to believe.</p>

<p>Well, leaving all this, I wish Mr. Mackay good luck, with some little
doubt of his success, but none of his intentions. I am come in my work
to that point where a lady who works a stocking must count by threads,
and bring the various loose ends of my story together. They are too
many.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 21.&mdash;Last night after dinner I rested from my work, and read
third part of [Theodore Hook's] <i>Sayings and Doings</i>, which shows great
knowledge of life in a certain sphere, and very considerable powers of
wit, which somewhat damages the effect of the tragic parts. But he is an
able writer, and so much of his work is well said, that it will carry
through what is <i>manqu&eacute;</i>. I hope the same good fortune for other folks.</p>

<p>I am watching and waiting till I hit on some quaint and clever mode of
extricating, but do not see a glimpse of any one. James B., too,
discourages me a good deal by his silence, waiting, I suppose, to be
invited to disgorge a full allowance of his critical bile. But he may
wait long enough, for I am discouraged enough. Now here is the advantage
of Edinburgh. In the country, if a sense of inability once seizes me, it
haunts me from morning to night; but in Edinburgh the time is so
occupied and frittered away by official duties and chance occupation,
that you have not time to play Master Stephen and be gentlemanlike and
melancholy.<a name="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> On the other hand, you never feel in town those
spirit-stirring influences&mdash;those glances of sunshine that make amends
for clouds and mist. The country is said to be quieter life; not to me,
I am sure. In the town the business I have to do hardly costs me more
thought than just occupies my mind, <a name="Page_129"></a>and I have as much of gossip and
ladylike chat as consumes the time pleasantly enough. In the country I
am thrown entirely on my own resources, and there is no medium betwixt
happiness and the reverse.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 22.&mdash;Went to Court, and remained there until one o'clock.
Then to Mr. Colvin Smith's and sat to be stared at till three o'clock.
This is a great bore even when you have a companion, sad when you are
alone and can only disturb the painter by your chatter. After dinner I
had proofs to the number of four. J.B. is outrageous about the death of
Oliver Proudfoot, one of the characters; but I have a humour to be
cruel.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;His business 'tis to die.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Received a present from a Mr. Dobie of a candlestick said to be that of
the Rev. Mr. Guthrie, minister of Fenwick in the seventeenth
century,&mdash;very civil of a gentleman unknown, if there comes no request
to look over poems, or to get made a gauger, or the like, for I have
seen that kind of compliment made on the principle on which small
balloons are sent up before a large one, to see how the wind sits. After
dinner proof-sheets.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 23.&mdash;Morning proof-sheets galore. Then to Parliament House.
After that, at one, down to Sir William MacLeod Bannatyne, who has made
some discoveries concerning Bannatyne the collector of poetry, and
furnished me with some notes to that purpose. He informs me that the
MacLeod, alias MacCruiskin, who met Dr. Johnson on the Isle of Skye, was
Mr. Alexander MacLeod, Advocate, a son of MacLeod of Muiravonside. He
was subject to fits of insanity at times, very clever at others.<a name="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a>
Sir William mentioned the old Laird of Bernera, who, summoned by his
Chief to join him with all the men he could make, when the Chief was
raising his men for Government, sent him a letter to this
purpose:&mdash;&quot;Dear Laird,&mdash;No man would like better to be at your back
<a name="Page_130"></a>than I would; but on this occasion it cannot be. I send my men, who are
at your service; for myself, higher duties carry me elsewhere.&quot; He went
off accordingly alone, and joined Raasay as a volunteer. I returned by
the printing office and found J.B. in great feather. He tells me Cadell,
on squaring his books and making allowance for bad debts, has made
between &pound;3000 and &pound;4000, lodged in bank. He does nothing but with me.
Thus we stand on velvet as to finance. Met Staffa,<a name="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> who walked with
me and gave me some Gaelic words which I wanted.</p>

<p>I may mention that I saw at the printing-office a part of a review on
Leigh Hunt's Anecdotes of Byron. It is written with power, apparently by
Professor Wilson, but with a degree of passion which rather diminishes
the effect; for nothing can more lessen the dignity of the satirist than
being or seeming to be in a passion. I think it may come to a bloody
arbitrament,<a name="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> for if L.H. should take it up as a gentleman, Wilson
is the last man to flinch. I hope Lockhart will not be dragged in as
second or otherwise. Went to Jeffrey's to dinner&mdash;there were Mrs. and
Miss Sydney Smith, Lords Gillies and Corehouse, etc. etc.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 24.&mdash;I fancy I had drunk a glass or two over <a name="Page_131"></a>much last
night, for I have the heartburn this morning. But a little magnesia
salves that sore. Meantime I have had an <i>inspiration</i> which shows me my
good angel has not left me. For these two or three days I have been at
what the &quot;Critic&quot; calls a dead-lock<a name="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a>&mdash;all my incidents and
personages ran into a gordian knot of confusion, to which I could devise
no possible extrication. I had thought on the subject several days with
something like the despair which seized the fair princess, commanded by
her ugly step-mother to assort a whole garret full of tangled silk
threads of every kind and colour, when in comes Prince Percinet with a
wand, whisks it over the miscellaneous mass, and lo! all the threads are
as nicely arranged as in a seamstress' housewife. It has often happened
to me that when I went to bed with my head as ignorant as my shoulders
what I was to do next, I have waked in the morning with a distinct and
accurate conception of the mode, good or bad, in which the plot might be
extricated. It seems to me that the action of the intellect, on such
occasions, is rather accelerated by the little fever which an extra
glass of wine produces on the system. Of course excess is out of the
question. Now this may seem strange, but it is quite true; and it is no
less so that I have generally written to the middle of one of these
novels, without having the least idea how it was to end, in short in the
<i>hab nab at a venture</i> style of composition. So now, this hitch being
over, I fold my paper, lock up my journal, and proceed to labour with
good hope.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 25.&mdash;This being Monday, I carried on my work according to the
new model. Dined at home and in quiet. But I may notice that yesterday
Mr. Williams, the learned Rector of our new Academy, who now leaves us,
took his dinner here. We had a long philological t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. He is
opinionative, as he has some title to be, but very learned, and with a
juster view of his subject than is commonly <a name="Page_132"></a>entertained, for he traces
words to the same source&mdash;not from sound but sense. He casts backwards
thus to the root, while many compare the ends of the twigs without going
further.</p>

<p>This night I went to the funeral of Mr. Henderson, late of Eildon Hall,
a kind-hearted man, who rose to great wealth by honest means, and will
be missed and regretted.</p>

<p>In the evening I went to the promenade in the Exhibition of Pictures,
which was splendidly lighted up and filled with fashionable company. I
think there was a want of beauty,&mdash;or perhaps the gas-lights were
unfavourable to the ladies' looks.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 26.&mdash;Business filled up the day till one, when I sat to Mr.
Smith. Tedious work, even though Will Clerk chaperoned me. We dined at
Archie Swinton's. Met Lord Lothian, Lord Cringletie, etc. This day I
have wrought almost nothing, but I am nearly half a volume before the
press. Lord Morton,<a name="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> married to a daughter of my friend Sir George
Rose, is come to Edinburgh. He seems a very gentlemanlike man, and she
pleasing and willing to be pleased. I had the pleasure to be of some
little use to him in his election as one of the Scottish Peers. I owe
Sir George Rose much for his attention to Walter at Berlin.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 27.&mdash;At Court till half-past two. Then to the Waterloo
Tavern, where we had a final and totally unfructuous meeting with the
Committee of the Coal Gas people. So now my journey to London is
resolved on. I shall lose at least &pound;500 by the job, and get little
thanks from those I make the sacrifice for. But the sacrifice shall be
made. Anything is better than to break one's word, or desert a sinking
vessel. Heartily do I wish these &quot;Colliers&quot; had seen the matter in the
best light for their own interest. But there is no help. One thing is
certain, that I shall see my whole family once more around me, and that
is worth the <a name="Page_133"></a>&pound;500. Anne too starts at the idea of the sea. I am
horribly vexed, however. Gibson always expected they would come in, but
there seemed to me little chance of it; perhaps they thought we were not
serious in our proposal to push through the Act. Wrought a little in the
evening, not much.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 28.&mdash;At Court till four. When I came home I did work a
little, but as we expected company it was not to much purpose. Lord
Chief Commissioner dined with us with Miss Adam; Mr. Hutchinson, brother
of Lord Donoughmore, and Miss Jones, Will Clerk and John Thomson made up
the party, and we had a pleasant evening, as such a handful always
secures. Stayed till wine-and-water time. Thus flew another day.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 29.&mdash;I had my proof-sheets as usual in the morning and the
Court as usual till two. Then one or two visits and corrected the
discourses for Gordon. This is really a foolish scrape, but what could I
do? It involved the poor lad's relief from something very like ruin. I
got a letter from the young man Reynolds accepting on Heath's part my
terms for article to <i>The Keepsake</i>, namely &pound;500,&mdash;I to be at liberty to
reprint the article in my works after three years. Mr. Heath to print it
in <i>The Keepsake</i> as long and often as he pleases, but not in any other
form. I shall close with them. If I make my proposed bargain with
Murray, all pecuniary matters will be easy in an unusual degree. Dined
at Robert Hamilton's with Lord and Lady Belhaven, Walter Campbell, and a
number of Westlanders.</p><a name="Page_134"></a>

<a name="MARCH_1828"></a><h2>MARCH.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>March</i> 1.&mdash;Wrought a little this morning; always creeping on. We had a
hard pull at the Court, and after it I walked a little for exercise, as
I fear indigestion from dining out so often.</p>

<p>Dined to-day with the bankers who went as delegates to London in Malachi
Malagrowther's days. Sir John Hay Kinnear and Tom Allan were my only
acquaintances of the party; the rest seemed shrewd capable men. I
particularly remarked a Mr. Sandeman with as intellectual a head as I
ever witnessed.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 2.&mdash;A day of hard work with little interruption, and completed
volume second. I am not much pleased with it. It wants what I desire it
to have, and that is passion.</p>

<p>The two Ballantynes and Mr. Cadell dined with me quietly. Heard from
London; all well.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 3.&mdash;I set about clearing my desk of unanswered letters, which I
had suffered to accumulate to an Augean heap. I daresay I wrote twenty
cards that might have been written at the time without half-a-minute
being lost. To do everything when it ought to be done is the soul of
expedition. But then, if you are interrupted eternally with these petty
avocations, the current of the mind is compelled to flow in shallows,
and you lose the deep intensity of thought which alone can float plans
of depth and magnitude. I sometimes wish I were one of those formalists
who can assign each hour of the day its special occupations, not to be
encroached upon; but it always <a name="Page_135"></a>returns upon my mind that I do better <i>&agrave;
la d&eacute;bandade</i>, than I could with rules of regular study. A work begun is
with me a stone turned over with the purpose of rolling it down hill.
The first revolutions are made with difficulty&mdash;but <i>vires acquirit
eundo</i>. Now, were the said stone arrested in its progress, the whole
labour would be to commence again. To take a less conceited simile: I am
like a spavined horse, who sets out lame and stiff, but when he warms in
his gear makes a pretty good trot of it, so that it is better to take a
good stage of him while you can get it. Besides, after all, I have known
most of those formalists, who were not men of business or of office to
whom hours are prescribed as a part of duty, but who voluntarily make
themselves</p>

<p>to be what I call very poor creatures.</p>

<p>General Ainslie looked in, and saddened me by talking of poor Don. The
General is a medallist, and entertains an opinion that the bonnet-piece
of James V. is the work of some Scottish artist who died young, and
never did anything else. It is far superior to anything which the Mint
produced since the Roman denarii. He also told me that the name of
Andrea de Ferrara is famous in Italy as an armourer.</p>

<p>Dined at home, and went to the Royal Society in the evening after
sending off my processes for the Sheriff Court. Also went after the
Society to Mr. James Russell's symposium.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 4.&mdash;A letter from Italy signed J.S. with many acute remarks on
inaccuracies in the life of Bonaparte.</p>

<p>His tone is hostile decidedly, but that shall not prevent my making use
of all his corrections where just.</p>

<p>The wretched publication of Leigh Hunt on the subject of Byron is to
bring forward Tom Moore's life of that dis<a name="Page_136"></a>tinguished poet, and I am
honoured and flattered by the information that he means to dedicate it
to me.<a name="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p>A great deal of worry in the Court to-day, and I lost my spectacles, and
was a dark and perplexed man&mdash;found them again though. Wrote to Lockhart
and to Charles, and will do more if I can, but am sadly done up. An old
friend came and pressed unmercifully some selfish request of his own to
ask somebody to do something for his son. I shall be glad to be at
Abbotsford to get rid of this town, where I have not, in the proper and
social sense of the word, a single friend whose company pleases me. In
the country I have always Tom Purdie.</p>

<p>Dined at the Lord Chief Commissioner's, where I met, the first time for
thirty years, my old friend and boon companion, with whom I shared the
wars of Bacchus, Venus, and sometimes of Mars. The past rushed on me
like a flood and almost brought tears into my eyes. It is no very
laudable exploit to record, but I once drank three bottles of wine with
this same rogue&mdash;Sir William Forbes and Sir Alexander Wood being of the
party. David Erskine of Cardross keeps his looks better than most of our
contemporaries. I hope we shall meet for a longer time.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 5.&mdash;I corrected sheets, and, being a Teind Wednesday, began the
second volume and proceeded as far as page fourth.</p>

<p>We dined at Hector Macdonald's with several Highlanders, most of whom
were in their garb, intending to go to a great fancy ball in the
evening. There were young Cluny Macpherson, Campbell Airds, Campbell
Saddell, and others of the race of Diarmid. I went for an hour to the
ball, where <a name="Page_137"></a>there were many gay and some grotesque figures. A dressed
ball is, for the first half-hour, a splendid spectacle; you see youth
and beauty dressed in their gayest attire, unlimited, save by their own
taste, and enjoying the conscious power of charming, which gives such
life and alacrity to the features. But the charm ceases in this like
everything else. The want of masks takes away the audacity with which
the disguised parties conduct themselves at a masquerade, and [leaves]
the sullen sheepishness which makes them, I suppose, the worst maskers
in Europe. At the only real masquerade which I have known in Edinburgh
there were many, if not most, of those who had determined to sustain
characters, who had more ill-breeding than facetiousness. The jests were
chiefly calculated to give pain, and two or three quarrels were with
difficulty prevented from ripening into duels. A fancy ball has no
offence in it, therefore cannot be wrecked on this rock. But, on the
other hand, it is horribly dull work when the first <i>coup d'&#339;il</i> is
over.</p>

<p>There were some good figures, and some grossly absurd. A very gay
cavalier with a broad bright battle-axe was pointed out to me as an
eminent distiller, and another knight in the black coarse armour of a
cuirassier of the 17th century stalked about as if he thought himself
the very mirror of chivalry. He was the son of a celebrated upholsterer,
so might claim the broad axe from more titles than one. There was some
good dancing; Cluny Macpherson footed it gallantly.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 6.&mdash;Wrote two pages this morning before breakfast. Went to the
Court, where I learned that the &quot;Colliers&quot; are in alarm at the
determination shown by our Committee, and are willing to give better
terms. I hope this is so&mdash;but <i>Cogan na Shie</i>&mdash;peace or war, I care not.
I never felt less anxiety about where I went and what I did. A feather
just lighted on the ground can scarce be less concerned where the next
blast may carry it. If I go, I shall see my <a name="Page_138"></a>children&mdash;if I stay, I
shall mend my fortune. Dined at home and went to the play in the
evening. Lady Torphichen had commanded the play, and there were all my
Swinton cousins young and old. The play was &quot;A Bold Stroke for a
Wife,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a>&mdash;Charles Kemble acting as Feignwell. The plot is extravagant
nonsense, but with lively acting the ludicrousness of the situation
bears it through, and few comedies act better. After this came <i>Rob
Roy</i>, where the Bailie played with his usual excellence. The piece was
not over until near one in the morning, yet I did not feel tired&mdash;which
is much.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 7.&mdash;To-day I wrought and corrected proof-sheets; went to the
Court, and had a worry at the usual trashy small wares which are
presented at the end of a Session. An official predecessor of mine, the
facetious Robert Sinclair, was wont to say the three last days of the
Session should be abolished by Act of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> Came home late,
and was a good deal broken in upon by visitors. Amongst others, John
Swinton, now of Swinton, brought me the skull of his ancestor, Sir Allan
Swinton, who flourished five hundred years ago. I will get a cast made
of the stout old carle. It is rare to see a genuine relic of the mortal
frame drawing so far back. Went to my Lord Gillies's to dinner, and
witnessed a singular exhibition of personification.</p>

<p>Miss Stirling Grame,<a name="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> a lady of the Duntroon family, <a name="Page_139"></a>from which
Clavers was descended, looks like thirty years old, and has a face of
the Scottish cast, with a good expression in point of good sense and
good humour. Her conversation, so far as I have had the advantage of
hearing it, is shrewd and sensible, but no ways brilliant. She dined
with us, went off as to the play, and returned in the character of an
old Scottish lady. Her dress and behaviour were admirable, and the
conversation unique. I was in the secret, of course, did my best to keep
up the ball, but she cut me out of all feather. The prosing account she
gave of her son, the antiquary, who found an auld wig in a slate quarry,
was extremely ludicrous, and she puzzled the Professor of Agriculture
with a merciless account of the succession of crops in the parks around
her old mansion-house. No person to whom the secret was not intrusted
had the least guess of an impostor, except one shrewd young lady
present, who observed the hand narrowly and saw it was plumper than the
age of the lady seemed to warrant. This lady, and Miss Bell<a name="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> of
Coldstream, have this gift of personification to a much higher degree
than any person I ever saw.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 8.&mdash;Wrote in the morning, then to Court, where we had a sederunt
till nigh two o'clock. From thence to the Coal Gas Committee, with whom
we held another, and, thank God, a final meeting. Gibson went with me.
They had Mr. Munro, Trotter, Tom Burns, and Inglis. The scene put me in
mind of Chichester Cheyne's story of a Shawnee <a name="Page_140"></a>Indian and himself,
dodging each other from behind trees, for six or seven hours, each in
the hope of a successful shot. There was bullying on both sides, but we
bullied to best purpose, for we must have surrendered at discretion,
notwithstanding the bold face we put on it. On the other hand, I am
convinced they have got a capital bargain.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 9.&mdash;I set about arranging my papers, a task which I always take
up with the greatest possible ill-will and which makes me cruelly
nervous. I don't know why it should be so, for I have nothing
particularly disagreeable to look at; far from it, I am better than I
was at this time last year, my hopes firmer, my health stronger, my
affairs bettered and bettering. Yet I feel an inexpressible nervousness
in consequence of this employment. The memory, though it retains all
that has passed, has closed sternly over it; and this rummaging, like a
bucket dropped suddenly into a well, deranges and confuses the ideas
which slumbered on the mind. I am nervous, and I am bilious, and, in a
word, I am unhappy. This is wrong, very wrong; and it is reasonably to
be apprehended that something of serious misfortune will be the deserved
punishment of this pusillanimous lowness of spirits. Strange that one
who, in most things, may be said to have enough of the 'care na by',
should be subject to such vile weakness! Well, having written myself
down an ass, I will daub it no farther, but e'en trifle till the humour
of work comes.</p>

<p>Before the humour came I had two or three long visits. Drummond Hay, the
antiquary and lyon-herald, came in.<a name="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> I do not know anything which
relieves the mind so much from the sullens as trifling discussion about
<i>antiquarian old-womanries</i>. It is like knitting a stocking, diverting
the mind without occupying it; or it is like, by Our Lady, a mill-dam,
which leads one's thoughts gently and imperceptibly out of the channel
in which they are chafing and boiling. To be <a name="Page_141"></a>sure, it is only
conducting them to turn a child's mill; what signifies that?&mdash;the
diversion is a relief, though the object is of little importance. I
cannot tell what we talked of; but I remember we concluded with a
lamentation on the unlikelihood that Government would give the Museum
&pound;2000 to purchase the <i>bronze Apollo</i> lately discovered in France,
although the God of Delos stands six feet two in his stocking-soles, and
is perfectly entire, saving that on the right side he wants half a hip,
and the leg from the knee, and that on the left his heel is much
damaged. Colonel Ferguson just come to town&mdash;dines with us.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 10.&mdash;I had a world of trumpery to do this morning: cards to
write, and business to transact, visits to make, etc. Received letters
from the youth who is to conduct <i>The Keepsake</i>, with blarney on a &pound;200
Bank note. No blarney in that. I must set about doing something for
these worthies. I was obliged to go alone to dine at Mr. Scott Gala's.
Met the Sinclair family. Lady Sinclair told me a singular story of a
decrepit man keeping a lonely toll at a place called the Rowan-tree, on
the frontiers, as I understood, between Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire
[Wigtownshire?]. It was a wild, lonely spot, and was formerly inhabited
by robbers and assassins, who murdered passengers. They were discovered
by a boy whom they had taken into the cottage as a menial. He had seen
things which aroused his attention, and was finally enlightened as to
the trade of his masters by hearing one of them, as he killed a goat,
remark that the cries of the creature resembled those of the last man
they had dealt with. The boy fled from the house, lodged an information,
and the whole household was seized and executed. The present inhabitants
Lady Sinclair described as interesting. The man's feet and legs had been
frost-bitten while herding the cattle, and never recovered the strength
of natural limbs. Yet he had acquired some education, and was a country
schoolmaster for some time, till the distance and loneliness of the spot
prevented pupils <a name="Page_142"></a>from attending. His daughter was a reader, and begged
for some old magazines, newspapers, or any printed book, that she might
enjoy reading. They might have been better had they been allowed to keep
a cow. But if they had been in comfortable circumstances, they would
have had visitors and lodgers, who might have carried guns to destroy
the gentleman's creation, <i>i.e.</i> game; and for this risk the wretches
were kept in absolute and abject poverty. I would rather be&mdash;himself
than this brutal Earl. The daughter showed Lady Sinclair a well in the
midst of a small bog, of great depth, into which, like Thurtell and
Probert, they used to thrust the bodies of their victims till they had
an opportunity of burying them. Lady Sinclair stooped to taste the
water, but the young woman said, with a strong expression of horror,
&quot;You would not drink it?&quot; Such an impression had the tale, probably two
centuries old, made upon the present inhabitants of this melancholy
spot. The whole legend is curious; I will try to get hold of it.<a name="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>March</i> 11.&mdash;I sent Reynolds a sketch of two Scottish stories for
subjects of art for his <i>Keepsake</i>&mdash;the death of the Laird's Jock the
one, the other the adventure of Duncan Stuart with the stag.</p>

<p>Mr. Drummond Hay breakfasted with me&mdash;a good fellow, but a considerable
bore. He brought me a beautiful bronze statue of Hercules, about ten
inches or a foot in height, beautifully wrought. He bought it in France
for 70 francs, and refused &pound;300 from Payne Knight. It is certainly a
most beautiful piece of art. The lion's hide which hung over the
shoulders had been of silver, and, to turn it to account, the arm over
which it hung was cut off; otherwise the statue was perfect and
extremely well wrought. Allan Swinton's skull sent back to Archibald
Swinton.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 12.&mdash;The boy got four leaves of copy to-day, and <a name="Page_143"></a>I wrote three
more. Received by Mr. Cadell from Treuttel and Wurtz for articles in
<i>Foreign Review</i> &pound;52, 10s., which is at my credit with him. Poor Gillies
has therefore kept his word so far, but it is enough to have sacrificed
&pound;100 to him already in literary labour, which I make him welcome to. I
cannot spare him more&mdash;which, besides, would do him no good.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 13, [<i>Abbotsford</i>].&mdash;I wrote a little in the morning and sent
off some copy. We came off from Edinburgh at ten o'clock, and got to
Abbotsford by four, where everything looks unusually advanced; the birds
singing and the hedges budding, and all other prospects of spring too
premature to be rejoiced in.</p>

<p>I found that, like the foolish virgins, the servants had omitted to get
oil for my lamp, so I was obliged to be idle all the evening. But though
I had a diverting book, the <i>Tales of the Munster Festivals,</i><a name="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> yet
an evening without writing hung heavy on my hands. The <i>Tales</i> are
admirable. But they have one fault, that the crisis is in more cases
than one protracted after a keen interest has been excited, to explain
and to resume parts of the story which should have been told before.
Scenes of mere amusement are often introduced betwixt the crisis of the
plot and the final catastrophe. This is impolitic. But the scenes and
characters are traced by a firm, bold, and true pencil, and my very
criticism shows that the catastrophe is interesting,&mdash;otherwise who
would care for its being interrupted?</p>

<p><i>March</i> [14 to] 16.&mdash;The same record applies to these three days. From
seven to half-past nine writing&mdash;from half-past nine to a quarter past
ten a hearty breakfast. From eleven or thereby, to one or two, wrote
again, and from one or two ride, drive, or walk till dinner-time&mdash;for
two or three hours&mdash;five till seven, dine and rest yourself&mdash;seven till
nine, wrote two pages more, from nine to quarter past ten lounge, read
the <a name="Page_144"></a>papers, and then go to bed. If your story is tolerably forward you
may, I think, keep at this rate for twelve days, which would be a
volume. But no brain could hold it out longer. Wrote two additional
leaves in the evening.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 17.&mdash;Sent away copy this morning to J.B. with proofs. I then
wrote all the day till two o'clock, walked round the thicket and by the
water-side, and returning set to work again. So that I have finished
five leaves before dinner, and may discuss two more if I can satisfy
myself with the way of winding up the story. There are always at the end
such a plaguey number of stitches to take up, which usually are never so
well done but they make a botch. I will try if the cigar will inspire
me. Hitherto I have been pretty clear, and I see my way well enough,
only doubt of making others see it with sufficient simplicity. But it is
near five, and I am too hungry to write more.<a name="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Ego nunquam potui scribere jejunus.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>March</i> 18.&mdash;I was sorely worried by the black dog this morning, that
vile palpitation of the heart&mdash;that <i>tremor cordis</i>&mdash;that hysterical
passion which forces unbidden sighs and tears, and falls upon a
contented life like a drop of ink on white paper, which is not the less
a stain because it conveys no meaning. I wrought three leaves, however,
and the story goes on. I dined at the Club of the Selkirkshire yeomanry,
now disbanded.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The Eldrich knight gave up his arms<br /></span>
<span>With many a sorrowful sigh.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The dissolution of the Yeomanry was the act of the last ministry. The
present did not alter the measure on account of the expense saved. I am
one of the oldest, if not the very oldest Yeoman in Scotland, and have
seen the rise, progress, and now the fall of this very constitutional
part of the national force. Its efficacy, on occasions of insurrection,
was sufficiently proved in the Radical time. But besides, it <a name="Page_145"></a>kept up a
spirit of harmony between the proprietors of land and the occupiers, and
made them known to and beloved by each other; and it gave to the young
men a sort of military and high-spirited character, which always does
honour to a country. The manufacturers are in great glee on this
occasion. I wish Parliament, as they have turned the Yeoman adrift
somewhat scornfully, may not have occasion to roar them in again.<a name="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>March</i> 19.&mdash;I applied myself again to my labour, my mind flowing in a
less, gloomy current than yesterday. I laboured with little
interruption, excepting a walk as far as Faldonside with the dogs, and
at night I had not finished more than three leaves. But, indeed, it is
pretty fair; I must not work my brains too hard, in case of provoking
the hypochondria which extreme exertion or entire indolence are equally
unfavourable to.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 20.&mdash;Thomson breakfasted. I left him soon, being desirous to
finish my labours. The volume is finished, all but one fourth or
somewhat shorter; four days should despatch it easily, but I have
letters to write and things are getting into disorder. I took a drive
with my daughter, for exercise, and called at Huntly Burn. This evening
went on with work as usual; there was not above four pages finished, but
my conscience is quiet on my exertions.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 21.&mdash;I received young Whytbank to breakfast, and talked
genealogy, which he understands well; I have not a head for it. I only
value it as interspersed with anecdote. Whytbank's relationship and mine
exists by the Shaws. A younger brother of Shaw of Sauchie, afterwards
Greenock, chief of the name, was minister of the Kirk of Selkirk. My
great-grandfather, John Rutherford, minister of the gospel at Yarrow,
married one of this reverend gentleman's daughters; and John Pringle,
rector of Fogo, great-grandfather of the present Whytbank, married
another. It was Christian Shaw, <a name="Page_146"></a>my grandmother, who possessed the
manuscript respecting the murder of the Shaws by the Master of
Sinclair.<a name="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> She could not, according to the reckoning of that age, be
a distant relation. Whytbank parted, agreeing to return to dinner to
meet the bride and bridegroom. I had little time to write, for Colonel
Russell, my cousin, called between one and two, and he also agreed to
stay dinner; so I had a walk of three hours with him in the plantations.
At dinner we had Mr. and Mrs. Bruce, Mr. Scrope, Mrs. and Dr. Brewster,
Whytbank, Russell, and young Nicol Milne, who will be a pleasant lad if
he had a little polish. I was glad of the society, as I had rather felt
the <i>besoin de parler</i>, which was perhaps one cause of my recent dumps.
Scrope and Colonel Russell stayed all night; the rest went home.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 22.&mdash;Had a packet from James&mdash;low about the novel; but I had
another from Cadell equally uppish. He proposes for three novels in
eighteen months, which would be &pound;12,600. Well, I like the bookseller's
predictions better than the printer's. Neither are bad judges; but
James, who is the best, is not sensible of historical descriptions, and
likes your novel style out and out.</p>

<p>Cadell's letter also contained a state of cash matters, since much
improved. I will arrange them a day or two hence. I wrote to-day and
took a long walk. The thought more than once passed over me, Why go to
London? I shall but throw away &pound;150 or &pound;200 which were better saved.
Then on the other hand, it is such a gratification to see all the
children that I must be tempted. If I were alone, I could scrub it, but
there's no doing that with Anne.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 23.&mdash;I wrought regularly till one, and then took the wood and
marked out to Tom the places I would have thinned, particularly at the
Carlin's hole, which will require <a name="Page_147"></a>much thinning. I had a letter from
Cadell stating that 3000 <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i> must go to press,
bringing a return to me of &pound;240, the price being &pound;80 per thousand. This
is snug enough, and will prettily cover my London journey, and I really
think ought in fairness to silence my prudential remorse. With my usual
delight in catching an apology for escaping the regular task of the day,
I threw by the novel of St. Valentine's Eve and began to run through and
correct the <i>Grandfather's Tales</i> for the press. If I live to finish
them, they will be a good thing for my younger children. If I work to
the amount of &pound;10,000 a year for the creditors, I think I may gain a few
hundreds for my own family at by-hours.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 24.&mdash;Sent copy and proof to J.B.<a name="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> I continued my revision of
the <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i> till half-past one. Then went to Torwoodlee
to wait on George Pringle and his bride. We did not see the young
people, but the old Laird and Miss Pringle gave us a warm reception, and
seemed very happy on the occasion. We had friends to dinner, Mr. and
Mrs. Theobald, Charles Kerr and his wife, my old acquaintance Magdalen
Hepburn, whose whole [kin] was known to me and mine. I have now seen the
fifth generation of the family in Mrs. Kerr's little girl, who travels
with them. Well&mdash;I partly wish we had been alone. Yet it is perhaps
better. We made our day out tolerably well, having the advantage of Mr.
Davidoff and his friend Mr. Collyer to assist us.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 25.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Kerr left us, Mr. Davidoff and Mr. Collyer
also. Mr. Davidoff showed himself a good deal <a name="Page_148"></a>affected. I hope well of
this young nobleman, and trust the result will justify my expectations,
but it may be doubted if his happiness be well considered by those who
send a young person, destined to spend his life under a despotic
government, to receive the ideas and opinions of such a people as we
are:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;where ignorance is bliss,<br /></span>
<span>'Tis folly to be wise.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We drove as far as Yair with Mr. and Mrs. Theobald. The lady read after
dinner&mdash;and read well.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 26.&mdash;The Theobalds left us, giving me time to work a little. A
walk of two hours diversified my day. I received Cadell's scheme for the
new edition. I fear the trustees will think Cadell's plan expensive in
the execution. Yet he is right; for, to ensure a return of speedy sale,
the new edition should be both handsome and cheap. He proposes size a
Royal 12mo, with a capital engraving to each volume from a design by the
best artists. This infers a monstrous expense, but in the present humour
of the public ensures the sale. The price will be 5s. per volume, and
the whole set, 32 volumes, from <i>Waverley</i> to <i>Woodstock</i> included, will
be &pound;8.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 27.&mdash;This also was a day of labour, affording only my usual
interval of a walk. Five or six sheets was the result. We now
appropinque an end. My story has unhappily a divided interest; there are
three distinct strands of the rope, and they are not well twisted
together. &quot;Ah, Sirs, a foul fawt,&quot; as Captain Tommy says.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 28.&mdash;The days have little to distinguish each other, very
little. The morning study, the noontide walk, all monotonous and
inclined to be melancholy; God help me! But I have not had any nervous
attack. Read <i>Tales of an Antiquary</i>,<a name="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> one of the chime of bells
which I have some hand in setting a-ringing. He is really entitled to
the name of an antiquary; but he has too much description in proportion
to <a name="Page_149"></a>the action. There is a capital wardrobe of properties, but the
performers do not act up to their character.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 29.&mdash;Finished volume third this morning. I have let no grass
grow beneath my heels this bout.</p>

<p>Mr. Cadell with J. and A. Ballantyne came to dinner. Mr. and Mrs. George
Pringle, new married, dined with us and old Torwoodlee. Sandy's music
made the evening go sweetly down.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 30.&mdash;A long discourse with Cadell, canvassing his scheme. He
proposes I should go on immediately with the new novel. This will
furnish a fund from which may be supplied the advances necessary for the
new work, which are considerable, and may reach from &pound;4000 to &pound;8000&mdash;the
last sum quite improbable&mdash;before it makes returns. Thus we can face the
expenditure necessary to set on foot our great work. I have written to
recommend the plan to John Gibson. This theme renewed from time to time
during the forenoon. Dr. Clarkson<a name="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> dined with us. We smoked and had
whisky and water after.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 31.&mdash;The Ballantynes and Cadell left us in high spirits,
expecting much from the new undertaking, and I believe they are not
wrong. As for me, I became torpid after a great influx of morning
visitors.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I grew vapourish and odd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And would not do the least right thing,<br /></span>
<span>Neither for goddess nor for god&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor paint nor jest nor laugh, nor sing.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I was quite reluctant to write letters, or do anything whatsoever, and
yet I should surely write to Sir Cuthbert Sharp and Surtees. We dined
alone. I was main stupid, indeed, and much disposed to sleep, though my
dinner was very moderate.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="APRIL_1828"></a><h2>APRIL.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>April</i> 1.&mdash;All Fools' day, the only Saint that keeps up some degree of
credit in the world; for fools we are with a vengeance. On this
memorable festival we played the fool with great decorum at Colonel
Ferguson's, going to visit them in a cold morning. In the evening I had
a distressing letter from Mrs. MacBarnet, or some such name, the
daughter of Captain Macpherson, smothered in a great snow storm. They
are very angry at the <i>Review</i> for telling a raw-head and bloody bones
story about him. I have given the right version of the tale willingly,
but this does not satisfy. I almost wish they would turn out a clansman
to be free of the cumber. The vexation of having to do with ladies, who
on such a point must be unreasonable, is very great. With a man it would
be soon ended or mended. It really hurts my sleep.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 2.&mdash;I wrote the lady as civilly as I could, explaining why I
made no further apology, which may do some good. Then a cursed morning
of putting to rights, which drives me well-nigh mad. At two or three I
must go to a funeral&mdash;a happy and interesting relief from my employment.
It is a man I am sorry for, who married my old servant, Bell Ormiston.
He was an excellent person in his way, and a capital mason&mdash;a great
curler.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 3.&mdash;Set off at eight o'clock, and fought forward to Carlisle&mdash;a
sad place in my domestic remembrances, since here I married my poor
Charlotte. She is gone, and I am following faster, perhaps, than I wot
of. It is something to <a name="Page_151"></a>have lived and loved; and our poor children are
so hopeful and affectionate, that it chastens the sadness attending the
thoughts of our separation. We slept at Carlisle. I have not forgiven
them for destroying their quiet old walls, and building two lumpy things
like mad-houses. The old gates had such a respectable appearance once,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;When Scotsmen's heads did guard the wall.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Come, I'll write down the whole stanza, which is all that was known to
exist of David Hume's poetry, as it was written on a pane of glass in
the inn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Here chicks in eggs for breakfast sprawl,<br /></span>
<span>Here godless boys God's glories squall,<br /></span>
<span>Here Scotsmen's heads do guard the wall,<br /></span>
<span>But Corby's walks atone for all.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poetical works of David Hume, Esq., might, as bookmakers know now,
be driven out to a handsome quarto. Line 1st admits of a descant upon
eggs roasted, boiled or poached; 2d, a history of Carlisle Cathedral
with some reasons why the choir there has been proverbially execrable;
3d, the whole history of 1745 with minute memoirs of such as mounted
guard on the Scotch gate. I remember the spikes the heads stood upon;
lastly, a description of Corby Castle with a plan, and the genealogy of
the Howards. Gad, the booksellers would give me &pound;500 for it. I have a
mind to print it for the Bannatynians.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 4.&mdash;In our stage to Penrith I introduced Anne to the ancient
Petreia, called Old Penrith, and also to the grave of Sir Ewain
C&aelig;sarias,<a name="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> that knight with the puzzling name, which has got more
indistinct. We breakfasted at Buchanan's Inn, Penrith, one of the best
on the road, and a fine stanch fellow owned it. He refused passage to
some of the delegates who traversed the country during the Radical row,
and when the worthies threatened him with popular <a name="Page_152"></a>vengeance, answered
gallantly that he had not lived so long by the Crown to desert it at a
pinch. The Crown is the sign of his inn. Slept at Garstang, an
indifferent house. As a petty grievance, my ink-holder broke loose in
the case, and spilt some of the ink on Anne's pelisse. Misfortunes
seldom come single. &quot;'Tis not alone the inky cloak, good daughter,&quot; but
I forgot at Garstang my two breastpins; one with Walter and Jane's hair,
another a harp of pure Irish gold, the gift of the ladies of
Llangollen.<a name="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>April</i> 5.&mdash;Breakfasted at Chorley, and slept at Leek. We were in the
neighbourhood of some fine rock-scenery, but the day was unfavourable;
besides, I did not come from Scotland to see rocks, I trow.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 6.&mdash;Easter Sunday. We breakfasted at Ashbourne and went from
thence to Derby; and set off from thence to Drycot Hall (five miles) to
visit Hugh Scott. But honest Hugh was, like ourselves, on the ramble; so
we had nothing to do but to drive back to Derby, and from thence to
Tamworth, where we slept.</p>

<p><i>April 7</i>.&mdash;We visited the Castle in the morning. It is inhabited by a
brother-in-law of the proprietor; and who is the proprietor? &quot;Why, Mr.
Robbins,&quot; said the fat housekeeper. This was not a name quite according
with the fine chivalrous old hall, in which there was no small quantity
of armour, and odds and ends, which I would have been glad to possess.
&quot;Well, but madam, before Mr. Robbins bought the place, who was the
proprietor?&quot; &quot;Lord Charles Townshend, sir.&quot; This would not do neither;
but a genealogy hanging above the chimney-piece informed me that the
Ferrars were the ancient possessors of the mansion, which, indeed, the
horseshoes in the shield over the Castle gate might have intimated.
Tamworth is a fine old place, neglected, but, therefore, more <a name="Page_153"></a>like hoar
antiquity. The keep is round. The apartments appear to have been
modernised <i>tempore</i> Jac. I<sup>mi</sup>*. There was a fine demipique saddle,
said to have been that of James II. The pommel rose, and finished off in
the form of a swan's crest, capital for a bad horseman to hold on by.</p>

<p>To show Anne what was well worth seeing, we visited Kenilworth. The
relentless rain only allowed us a glimpse of this memorable ruin. Well,
the last time I was here, in 1815,<a name="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> these trophies of time were
quite neglected. Now they approach so much nearer the splendour of
Thunder-ten-tronckh, as to have a door at least, if not windows. They
are, in short, preserved and protected. So much for the novels. I
observed decent children begging here, a thing uncommon in England: and
I recollect the same unseemly practice formerly.</p>

<p>We went to Warwick Castle. The neighbourhood of Leamington, a
watering-place of some celebrity, has obliged the family to decline
showing the Castle after ten o'clock. I tried the virtue of an old
acquaintance with Lord Warwick and wrote to him, he being in the
Courthouse where the assizes were sitting. After some delay we were
admitted, and I found my old friend Mrs. Hume, in the most perfect
preservation, though, as she tells me, now eighty-eight. She went
<a name="Page_154"></a>through her duty wonderfully, though now and then she complained of her
memory. She has laid aside a mass of black plumes which she wore on her
head, and which resembled the casque in the Castle of Otranto. Warwick
Castle is still the noblest sight in England. Lord and Lady Warwick came
home from the Court, and received us most kindly. We lunched with them,
but declined further hospitality. When I was last here, and for many
years before, the unfortunate circumstances of the late Lord W. threw an
air of neglect about everything. I believe the fine collection of
pictures would have been sold by distress, if Mrs. Hume, my friend, had
not redeemed them at her own cost.<a name="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> I was pleased to see Lord
Warwick show my old friend kindness and attention. We visited the
monuments of the Nevilles and Beauchamps, names which make the heart
thrill. The monuments are highly preserved. We concluded the day at
Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 8.&mdash;We visited the tomb of the mighty wizard. It is in the bad
taste of James the First's reign; but what a magic does the locality
possess! There are stately monuments of forgotten families; but when you
have seen Shakspeare's what care we for the rest. All around is
Shakspeare's exclusive property. I noticed the monument of his friend
John a Combe immortalised as drawing forth a brief satirical notice of
four lines.</p>

<p>After breakfast I asked after Mrs. Ormsby, the old mad woman who was for
some time tenant of Shakspeare's house, and conceived herself to be
descended from the immortal poet. I learned she was dying. I thought to
send her a sovereign; but this extension of our tour has left me no more
than will carry me through my journey, and I do not like to run short
<a name="Page_155"></a>upon the road. So I take credit for my good intention, and&mdash;keep my
sovereign&mdash;a cheap and not unusual mode of giving charity.</p>

<p>Learning from Washington Irving's description of Stratford that the hall
of Sir Thomas Lucy, the justice who rendered Warwickshire too hot for
Shakspeare, and drove him to London, was still extant, we went in quest
of it.</p>

<p>Charlcote is in high preservation, and inhabited by Mr. Lucy, descendant
of the worshipful Sir Thomas. The Hall is about three hundred years old,
an old brick structure with a gate-house in advance. It is surrounded by
venerable oaks, realising the imagery which Shakspeare loved so well to
dwell upon; rich verdant pastures extend on every side, and numerous
herds of deer were reposing in the shade. All showed that the Lucy
family had retained their &quot;land and beeves.&quot; While we were surveying the
antlered old hall, with its painted glass and family pictures, Mr. Lucy
came to welcome us in person, and to show the house, with the collection
of paintings, which seems valuable, and to which he had made many
valuable additions.</p>

<p>He told me the park from which Shakspeare stole the buck was not that
which surrounds Charlcote, but belonged to a mansion at some distance
where Sir Thomas Lucy resided at the time of the trespass. The tradition
went that they hid the buck in a barn, part of which was standing a few
years ago, but now totally decayed. This park no longer belongs to the
Lucys. The house bears no marks of decay, but seems the abode of ease
and opulence. There were some fine old books, and I was told of many
more which were not in order. How odd if a folio Shakspeare should be
found amongst them! Our early breakfast did not prevent my taking
advantage of an excellent repast offered by the kindness of Mr. and Mrs.
Lucy, the last a lively Welshwoman. This visit gave me great pleasure;
it really brought Justice Shallow freshly before my eyes; <a name="Page_156"></a>the luces in
his arms &quot;which do become an old coat well&quot;<a name="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> were not more plainly
portrayed in his own armorials in the hall-window than was his person in
my mind's eye. There is a picture shown as that of the old Sir Thomas,
but Mr. Lucy conjectures it represents his son. There were three
descents of the same name of Thomas. The party hath &quot;the eye severe, and
beard of formal cut,&quot; which fills up with judicial austerity the
otherwise social physiognomy of the worshipful presence, with his &quot;fair
round belly with fat capon lined.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p>We resumed our journey. I may mention among the pictures at Charlcote
one called a Roman Knight, which seemed to me very fine; Teniers'
marriage, in which, contrary to the painter's wont, only persons of
distinction are represented, but much in the attitude in which he
delights to present his boors; two hawking pieces by Wouvermans, very
fine specimens, <i>cum aliis</i>.</p>

<p>We took our way by Edgehill, and looked over the splendid richness of
the fine prospect from a sort of gazeeboo or modern antique tower, the
place of a Mr. Miller. It is not easy to conceive a richer and more
peaceful scene than that which stretched before us, and [one with which]
strife, or the memory of strife, seems to have nothing to do.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;But man records his own disgrace,<br /></span>
<span>And Edgehill lives in history.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We got on to Buckingham, an ugly though I suppose an ancient town.
Thence to Aylesbury through the wealth of England, in the scene of the
old ballad&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Neither drunk nor sober, but neighbour to both,<br /></span>
<span>I met with a man in Aylesbury vale;<br /></span>
<span>I saw by his face that he was in good case,<br /></span>
<span>To speak no great harm of a pot of good ale.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We slept at Aylesbury. The landlord, who seemed sensible, <a name="Page_157"></a>told me that
the land round the town, being the richest in England, lets at &pound;3, or
&pound;3, 10s. and some so high as &pound;4 per acre. <i>But</i> the poor-rates are 13s.
to the pound. Now, my Whitehaugh at Huntly Burn yielded at last set &pound;4
per acre.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 9, [<i>London</i>],&mdash;We got to town about mid-day, and found Sophia,
Lockhart, and the babies quite well&mdash;delighted with their companion
Charles, and he enchanted with his occupation in the Foreign Office. I
looked into my cash and found &pound;53 had diminished on the journey down to
about &pound;3. In former days a journey to London cost about &pound;30 or thirty
guineas. It may now cost one-fourth more. But I own I like to pay
postilions and waiters rather more liberally than perhaps is right. I
hate grumbling and sour faces; and the whole saving will not exceed a
guinea or two for being cursed and damned from Dan to Beersheba. We had
a joyful meeting, I promise you.<a name="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>April</i> 10.&mdash;I spent the morning in bringing up my journal; interrupted
by two of these most sedulous visitants who had objects of their own to
serve, and smelled out my arrival as the raven scents carrion&mdash;a vile
comparison, though what better is an old fellow, mauled with rheumatism
and other deplorables? Went out at two and saw Miss Dumergue and other
old friends; Sotheby in particular, less changed than any one I have
seen. Looked in at Murray's and renewed old habits. This great city
seems almost a waste to me, so many of my friends are gone; Walter and
Jane coming up, the whole family dined together, and were very happy.
The children joined in our festivity. My name-son, a bright and
blue-eyed rogue, with flaxen hair, screams and laughs like an April
morning; and the baby is that species <a name="Page_158"></a>of dough which is called a fine
baby. I care not for children till they care a little for me.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 11.&mdash;Made calls, walked myself tired; saw Rogers, Sharp,
Sotheby, and other old friends.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 12.&mdash;Dinner at home; a little party of Sophia's in the evening.
Sharp told me that one evening being at Sheridan's house with a large
party, Tom S. came to him as the night drew late, and said in a whisper,
&quot;I advise you to secure a wax-light to go to bed with,&quot; shewing him at
the same time a morsel which he had stolen from a sconce. Sharp followed
his advice, and had reason to be thankful for the hint. Tired and
sleepy, I make a bad night watcher.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 13.&mdash;Amused myself by converting the <i>Tale of the Mysterious
Mirror</i> into <i>Aunt Margaret's Mirror</i>, designed for Heath's
what-dye-call-it. Cadell will not like this, but I cannot afford to have
my goods thrown back upon my hands. The tale is a good one, and is said
actually to have happened to Lady Primrose, my great-grandmother having
attended her sister on the occasion. Dined with Miss Dumergue. My proofs
from Edinburgh reached to-day and occupied me all the morning.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 14. Laboured at proofs and got them sent off, per Mr. Freeling's
cover. So there's an end of the <i>Chronicles</i>.<a name="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> James rejoices in the
conclusion, where there is battle and homicide of all kinds. Always
politic to keep a trot for the avenue, like the Irish postilions. J.B.
always calls to the boys to flog before the carriage gets out of the
inn-yard. How we have driven the stage I know not and care not&mdash;except
with a view to extricating my difficulties. I have <a name="Page_159"></a>lost no time in
beginning the second series of <i>Grandfather's Tales</i>, being determined
to write as much as I can even here, and deserve by industry the soft
pillow I sleep on for the moment.</p>

<p>There is a good scene supposed to have happened between Sam Rogers and a
lady of fashion&mdash;the reporter, Lord Dudley. Sam enters, takes a stool,
creeps close to the lady's side, who asks his opinion of the last new
poem or novel. In a pathetic voice the spectre replies&mdash;&quot;My opinion? I
like it very much&mdash;but the world don't like it; but, indeed, I begin to
think the world wrong in everything, except with regard to <i>you</i>.&quot; Now,
Rogers either must have said this somewhere, or he has it yet to say. We
dined at Lord Melville's.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 15.&mdash;Got the lamentable news that Terry is totally bankrupt.
This is a most unexpected blow, though his carelessness about money
matters was very great. God help the poor fellow! he has been
ill-advised to go abroad, but now returns to stand the storm&mdash;old debts,
it seems, with principal and interest accumulated, and all the items
which load a falling man. And wife such a good and kind creature, and
children. Alack! alack! I sought out his solicitor. There are &pound;7000 or
more to pay, and the only fund his share in the Adelphi Theatre, worth
&pound;5000 and upwards, and then so fine a chance of independence lost. That
comes of not being explicit with his affairs. The theatre was a most
flourishing concern. I looked at the books, and since have seen Yates.
The ruin is inevitable, but I think they will not keep him in prison,
but let him earn his bread by his very considerable talents. I shall
lose the whole or part of &pound;500 which I lent him, but that is the least
of my concern. I hope the theatre is quite good for guaranteeing certain
payments in 1829 and 1830. I judge they are in no danger.</p>

<p>I should have gone to the Club to-day, but Sir James<a name="Page_160"></a> Mackintosh had
mistaken the day. I was glad of it, so stayed at home.</p>

<p>It is written that nothing shall flourish under my shadow&mdash;the
Ballantynes, Terry, Nelson, Weber, all came to distress. Nature has
written on my brow, &quot;Your shade shall be broad, but there shall be no
protection derived from it to aught you favour.&quot;</p>

<p>Sat and smoked and grumbled with Lockhart.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 16.&mdash;We dined at Dr. Young's; saw Captain Parry, a handsome and
pleasant man. In the evening at Mr. Cunliffe's, where I met sundry old
friends&mdash;grown older.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 17.&mdash;Made up my &quot;Gurnal,&quot; which had fallen something behind. In
this phantasmagorial place the objects of the day come and depart like
shadows.<a name="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> Made calls. Gave [C.K.] Sharpe's memorial to Lord Leveson
Gower. Went to Murray's, where I met a Mr. Jacob, a great economist. He
is proposing a mode of supporting the poor, by compelling them to labour
by military force, and under a species of military discipline. I see no
objection to it, only <a name="Page_161"></a>it will make a rebellion to a certainty; and the
tribes of Jacob will certainly cut Jacob's throat.<a name="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

<p>Canning's conversion from popular opinions was strangely brought round.
While he was studying at the Temple, and rather entertaining
revolutionary opinions, Godwin sent to say that he was coming to
breakfast with him, to speak on a subject of the highest importance.
Canning knew little of him, but received his visit, and learned to his
astonishment, that in expectation of a new order of things, the English
Jacobins desired to place him, Canning, at the head of their expected
revolution. He was much struck, and asked time to think what course he
should take&mdash;and, having thought the matter over, he went to Mr. Pitt
and made the Anti-Jacobin confession of faith, in which he persevered
until&mdash;&mdash;. Canning himself mentioned this to Sir W. Knighton, upon
occasion of giving a place in the Charter-house, of some ten pounds a
year, to Godwin's brother. He could scarce do less for one who had
offered him the dictator's curule chair.</p>

<p>Dined with Rogers with all my own family, and met Sharp, Lord John
Russell, Jekyll, and others. The conversation flagged as usual, and
jokes were fired like minute guns, producing an effect not much less
melancholy,&mdash;a wit should always have an atmosphere congenial to him,
otherwise he will not shine. Went to Lady Davy's, where I saw the kind
face, and heard the no less friendly greeting, of Lady Selkirk,<a name="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> who
introduced all her children to me.</p>
<a name="Page_162"></a>
<p><i>April</i> 18.&mdash;Breakfasted with Joanna Baillie, and found that gifted
person extremely well, and in the display of all her native knowledge of
character and benevolence. She looks more aged, however. I would give as
much to have a capital picture of her as for any portrait in the world.
She gave me a manuscript play to read upon Witchcraft.<a name="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> Dined with
the Dean of Chester, Dr. Phillpotts.<a name="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Where all above us was a solemn row<br /></span>
<span>Of priest and deacons, so were all below.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There were the amiable Bishop of London (Howley<a name="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a>), Coplestone, whom
I remember a first man at Oxford, now Bishop of Llandaff, the Dean of
St. Paul's, and other dignitaries of whom I knew less. It was a very
pleasant day&mdash;the wigs against the wits for a guinea in point of
conversation. Anne looked queer, and much disposed to laugh at finding
herself placed betwixt two prelates [in black petticoats].</p>

<p><i>April</i> 19.&mdash;Breakfasted with Sir George Philips. Had his receipt
against the blossoms being injured by frost. It consists in watering
them plentifully before sunrise. This is like the mode of thawing beef.
We had a pleasant morning, much the better that Morritt was with us. He
has agreed to go to Hampton Court with us to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Reynolds called on me about the drawing of the Laird's Jock; he is
assiduous and attentive, but a little forward. Poor Gillies also called.
Both asked me to dinner, but I refused. I do not incline to make what is
called literary acquaintances; and as for poor G., it is wild to talk
about his giving dinner to others, when he can hardly get credit for his
own.</p>

<p>Dined with Sir Robert Henry Inglis, and met Sir Thomas</p>

<p><a name="Page_163"></a>Acland, my old and kind friend. I was happy to see him. He may be
considered now as the head of the religious party in the House of
Commons, a powerful body which Wilberforce long commanded. It is a
difficult situation; for the adaptation of religious motives to earthly
policy is apt&mdash;among the infinite delusions of the human heart&mdash;to be a
snare. But I could confide much in Sir T. Acland's honour and integrity.
Bishop Blomfield [of Chester],<a name="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> one of the most learned prelates of
the church, also dined.</p>

<p>Coming home, an Irish coachman drove us into a <i>cul de sac</i>, near
Battersea Bridge. We were obliged to get out in the rain. The people
admitted us into their houses, where they were having their bit of
supper, assisted with lights, etc., and, to the honour of London,
neither asked nor expected gratification.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 20.&mdash;We went to Walter's quarters in a body, and saw Hampton
Court, with which I was more struck than when I saw it for the first
time, about 1806. The pictures are not very excellent, but they are
curious, which is as interesting, except to connoisseurs. Two I
particularly remarked, of James I. and Charles I. eating in public. The
old part of the palace, built by Wolsey, is extremely fine. Two handsome
halls are still preserved: one, the ceiling of which is garnished, at
the crossing and combining of the arches, with the recurring heads of
Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn&mdash;great stinginess in Henry, for these
ornaments must have been put up after Wolsey's fall. He could surely
afford a diversity of this species of ornament if any man could.
Formerly, when the palace was completely a fishing-house, it extended
into, or rather over, the river. We had a good dinner from Walter, and
wended merrily home.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 21.&mdash;Dining is the principal act of the day in London. We took
ours at Kensington with Croker. There <a name="Page_164"></a>were Theodore Hook and other
witty men. He looks unhealthy and bloated. There was something, I know
not what, awanting to the cheerfulness of the party. And</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Silence like a heavy cloud,<br /></span>
<span>O'er all the warriors hung.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the general report of Croker's retiring be accurate, it may account
for this.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 22.&mdash;Sophia left this to take down poor Johnnie to Brighton. I
fear&mdash;I fear&mdash;but we must hope the best. Anne went with her sister.</p>

<p>Lockhart and I dined with Sotheby, where we met a large dining party,
the orator of which was that extraordinary man Coleridge. After eating a
hearty dinner, during which he spoke not a word, he began a most learned
harangue on the Samothracian Mysteries, which he considered as affording
the germ of all tales about fairies past, present, and to come. He then
diverged to Homer, whose Iliad he considered as a collection of poems by
different authors, at different times during a century. There was, he
said, the individuality of an age, but not of a country. Morritt, a
zealous worshipper of the old bard, was incensed at a system which would
turn him into a polytheist, gave battle with keenness, and was joined by
Sotheby, our host. Mr. Coleridge behaved with the utmost complaisance
and temper, but relaxed not from his exertions. &quot;Zounds! I was never so
bethumped with words.&quot; Morritt's impatience; must have cost him an extra
sixpence worth of snuff.<a name="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="Page_165"></a>We went to Lady Davy's in the evening, where there was a fashionable
party.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 23.&mdash;- Dined at Lady Davy's with Lord and Lady Lansdowne, and
several other fashionable folks. My keys were sent to Bramah's with my
desk, so I have not had the means of putting matters down regularly for
several days; but who cares for the whipp'd cream of London society? Our
poor little Johnnie is extremely ill. My fears have been uniform for
this engaging child. We are in God's hands. But the comfortable and
happy object of my journey is ended,&mdash;Seged, Emperor of Ethiopia,<a name="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a>
was right after all.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 24.&mdash;Spent the day in rectifying a road bill which drew a
turnpike road through all the Darnickers' cottages, and a good field of
my own. I got it put to rights. I was in some apprehension of being
obliged to address the Committee. I did not fear them, for I suppose
they are no wiser or better in their capacity of legislators than I find
them every day at dinner. But I feared for my reputation. They would
have expected something better than the occasion demanded, or the
individual could produce, and there would have been a failure.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 25.&mdash;Threatened to be carried down to vote at the election of a
Collector of the Cess.<a name="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> Resolved if I did go to carry my son with
me, which would give me a double vote.</p>

<p><a name="Page_166"></a>Had some disagreeable correspondence about this with Lord Minto and the
Sheriff.</p>

<p>We had one or two persons at home in great wretchedness to dinner.
Lockhart's looks showed the misery he felt. I was not able to make any
fight, and the evening went off as heavily as any I ever spent in the
course of my life.</p>

<p>Finished my Turnpike business by getting the exceptionable clauses
omitted, which would be good news to Darnick. Put all the <i>Mirror</i> in
proof and corrected it. This is the contribution (part of it) to Mr.
Reynolds' and Heath's <i>Keepsake</i>. We dined at Richardson's with the two
chief Barons of England<a name="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> and Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> Odd enough, the one
being a Scotsman and the other an Englishman. Far the pleasantest day we
have had; I suppose I am partial, but I think the lawyers beat the
bishops, and the bishops beat the wits.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 26.&mdash;This morning I went to meet a remarkable man, Mr. Boyd of
the house of Boyd, Benfield &amp; Co., which broke for a very large sum at
the beginning of the war. Benfield went to the devil, I believe. Boyd, a
man of a very different stamp, went over to Paris to look after some
large claims which his house had over the French Government. They were
such as it seems they could not disavow, however they might be disposed
to do so. But they used every effort, by foul means and fair, to induce
Mr. Boyd to depart. He was reduced to poverty; he was thrown into
prison; and the most flattering prospects were, on the other hand, held
out to him if he would compromise his claims. His answer was uniform. It
was the property, he said, of his creditors, and he would die ere he
resigned it. His distresses were so great that a subscription was made
among his Scottish friends, to which I was a contributor, through the
request of poor Will Erskine. After the peace of Paris the money was
<a name="Page_167"></a>restored, and, faithful to the last, Boyd laid the whole at his
creditors' disposal; stating, at the same time, that he was penniless
unless they consented to allow him a moderate sum in name of percentage,
in consideration of twenty years of danger, poverty, and [exile], all of
which evils he might have escaped by surrendering their right to the
money. Will it be believed that a muck-worm was base enough to refuse
his consent to this deduction, alleging he had promised to his father,
on his death-bed, never to compromise this debt. The wretch, however,
was overpowered by the execrations of all around him, and concurred,
with others, in setting apart for Mr. Boyd a sum of &pound;40,000 or &pound;50,000
out of half a million of money.<a name="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> This is a man to whom statues
should be erected, and pilgrims should go to see him. He is
good-looking, but old and infirm. Bright dark eyes and eyebrows contrast
with his snowy hair, and all his features mark vigour of principle and
resolution. Mr. Morritt dined with us, and we did as well as in the
circumstances could be expected.</p>

<p>Released from the alarm of being summoned down to the election by a
civil letter from Lord Minto. I am glad both of the relief and of the
manner. I hate civil war amongst neighbours.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 27.&mdash;Breakfasted this day with Charles Dumergue on a <i>poulet &agrave;
la tartare</i>, and saw all his family, specially my godson. Called on Lady
Stafford and others, and dined at Croker's in the Admiralty, with the
Duke of Wellington, Huskisson, Wilmot Horton, and others, outs and ins.
No politics of course, and every man disguising serious thoughts with a
light brow. The Duke alone seemed open, though not letting out a word.
He is one of the few whose lips are worth watching. I heard him say
to-day that the best troops would <a name="Page_168"></a>run now and then. He thought nothing
of men running, he said, provided they came back again. In war he had
always his reserves. Poor Terry was here when I returned. He seems to
see his matters in a delusive light.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 28.&mdash;An attack this day or yesterday from poor Gillies, boring
me hard to apply to Menzies of Pitfoddels to entreat him to lend him
money. I could not get him to understand that I was decidedly averse to
write to another gentleman, with whom I was hardly acquainted, to do
that which I would not do myself. Tom Campbell<a name="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> is in miserable
distress&mdash;his son insane&mdash;his wife on the point of becoming so. <i>I nunc,
et versus tecum meditare canoros.</i><a name="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p>We, <i>i.e.</i> Charles and I, dined at Sir Francis Freeling's with Colonel
Harrison of the Board of Green Cloth, Dr. [Maltby] of Lincoln's Inn, and
other pleasant people. Doctor Dibdin too, and Utterson, all old
Roxburghe men. Pleasant party, were it not for a bad cold, which makes
me bark like a dog.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 29.&mdash;Anne and Lockhart are off with the children this morning at
seven, and Charles and I left behind; and this is the promised meeting
of my household! I went to Dr. Gilly's to-day to breakfast. Met Sir
Thomas Acland, who is the youngest man of his age I ever saw. I was so
much annoyed with cough, that, on returning, I took to my bed and had a
siesta, to my considerable refreshment. Dr. Fergusson called, and
advised caution in eating and drinking, which I will attend to.</p>

<p>Dined accordingly. Duke of Sussex had cold and did not come. A Mr. or
Dr. Pettigrew made me speeches on his account, and invited me to see his
Royal Highness's library, which I am told is a fine one. Sir Peter
Laurie, late Sheriff, and in nomination to be Lord Mayor, bored <a name="Page_169"></a>me
close, and asked more questions than would have been thought warrantable
at the west end of the town.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 30.&mdash;We had Mr. Adolphus and his father, the celebrated lawyer,
to breakfast, and I was greatly delighted with the information of the
latter. A barrister of extended practice, if he has any talents at all,
is the best companion in the world.<a name="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p>Dined with Lord Alvanley and a fashionable party, Lord Fitzroy Somerset,
Marquis and Marchioness of Worcester, etc. Lord Alvanley's wit made the
party very pleasant, as well as the kind reception of my friends the
Misses Arden.</p>
<a name="Page_170"></a>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="MAY_1828"></a><h2>MAY.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>May</i> 1.&mdash;Breakfasted with Lord and Lady Leveson Gower,<a name="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> and enjoyed
the splendid treat of hearing Mrs. Arkwright sing her own music,<a name="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a>
which is of the highest order&mdash;no forced vagaries of the voice, no
caprices of tone, but all telling upon and increasing the feeling the
words require. This is &quot;marrying music to immortal verse.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> Most
people place them on separate maintenance.</p>

<p>I met the Roxburghe Club, and settled to dine with them on 15th curt.
Lord Spencer in the chair. We voted Lord Olive<a name="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> a member.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 2.&mdash;I breakfasted with a Mr. Bell, Great Ormond Street, a lawyer,
and narrowly escaped Mr. Irving, the celebrated preacher. The two ladies
of the house seemed devoted to his opinions, and quoted him at every
word. Mr. Bell himself made some apologies for the Millennium. He is a
smart little antiquary, who thinks he ought to have been a man of
letters, and that his genius has been mis-directed in turning towards
the law. I endeavoured to combat this idea, which his handsome house and
fine family should have <a name="Page_171"></a>checked. Compare his dwelling, his comforts,
with poor Tom Campbell's!</p>

<p>I dined with the Literary Society; rather heavy work, though some
excellent men were there. I saw, for the first time, Archdeacon Nares,
long conductor of the <i>British Critic</i>, a gentlemanlike and pleasing
man. Sir Henry Robert Inglis presided.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 3.&mdash;Breakfasted at my old friend Gally Knight's, with whom, in
former days, I used to make little parties to see poor Monk Lewis. After
breakfast I drove to Lee and Kennedy's, and commissioned seeds and
flowers for about &pound;10, including some specimens of the Corsican and
other pines. Their collection is very splendid, but wants, I think, the
neatness that I would have expected in the first nursery-garden in or
near London. The essentials were admirably cared for. I saw one specimen
of the Norfolk Island pine, the only one, young Lee said, which has been
raised from all the seed that was sent home. It is not treated
conformably to its dignity, for they cut the top off every year to
prevent its growing out at the top of the conservatory. Sure it were
worth while to raise the house alongst with the plant.</p>

<p>Looked in at Murray's&mdash;wrote some letters, etc., and walked home with
the Dean of Chester, who saw me to my own door. I had but a few minutes
to dress, and go to the Royal Academy, to which I am attached in
capacity of Professor of Antiquities. I was too late to see the
paintings, but in perfect time to sit half-an-hour waiting for dinner,
as the President, Sir Thomas Lawrence, expected a prince of the blood.
He came not, but there were enough of grandees besides. Sir Thomas
Lawrence did the honours very well, and compliments flew about like
sugar-plums at an Italian carnival. I had my share, and pleaded the
immunities of a sinecurist for declining to answer.</p>

<p>After the dinner I went to Mrs. Scott of Harden, to see and be seen by
her nieces, the Herbert ladies. I don't know <a name="Page_172"></a>how their part of the
entertainment turned out, but I saw two or three pretty girls.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 4.&mdash;I breakfasted this morning with Sir Coutts Trotter, and had
some Scottish talk. Visited Cooper, who kindly undertook to make my
inquiries in Lyons.<a name="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> I was at home afterwards for three hours, but
too much tired to do the least right thing. The distances in London are
so great that no exertions, excepting those which a bird might make, can
contend with them. You return weary and exhausted, fitter for a siesta
than anything else. In the evening I dined with Mr. Peel, a great
Cabinet affair, and too dignified to be very amusing, though the
landlord and the pretty landlady did all to make us easy.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 5.&mdash;Breakfasted with Haydon, and sat for my head. I hope this
artist is on his legs again. The King has given him a lift by buying his
clever picture of the election in the Fleet prison, to which he is
adding a second part, representing the chairing of the member at the
moment it was interrupted by the entry of the guards. Haydon was once a
great admirer and companion of the champions of the Cockney school, and
is now disposed to renounce them and their opinions. To this kind of
conversation I did not give much way. A painter should have nothing to
do with politics. He is certainly a clever fellow, but somewhat too
enthusiastic, which distress seems to have cured in some degree. His
wife, a pretty woman, looked happy to see me, and that is something. Yet
it was very little I could do to help them.<a name="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p>Dined at Lord Bathurst's, in company with the Duke. There are better
accounts of Johnnie. But, alas!</p>

<p><i>May</i> 7.&mdash;Breakfasted with Lord Francis Gower, and <a name="Page_173"></a>again enjoyed the
great pleasure of meeting Mrs. Arkwright, and hearing her sing. She is,
I understand, quite a heaven-born genius, having scarce skill enough in
music to write down the tunes she composes. I can easily believe this.
There is a pedantry among great musicians that deprives their
performances of much that is graceful and beautiful. It is the same in
the other fine arts, where fashion always prefers cant and slang to
nature and simplicity.</p>

<p>Dined at Mr. Watson Taylor's, where plate, etc., shone in great and
somewhat ostentatious quantity. C[roker] was there, and very decisive
and overbearing to a great degree. Strange so clever a fellow should let
his wit outrun his judgment!<a name="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> In general, the English understand
conversation well. There is that ready deference for the claims of every
one who wishes to speak time about, and it is seldom now-a-days that &quot;a
la stoccata&quot; carries it away thus.<a name="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p>I should have gone to the Duchess of Northumberland's to hear music
to-night, but I felt completely fagged, and betook myself home to bed.</p>

<p>I learned a curious thing from Emily, Lady Londonderry, namely, that in
feeding all animals with your hand, you should never wear a glove, which
always affronts them. It is good authority for this peculiarity.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 8.&mdash;Breakfasted at Somerset House with Davies Gilbert, the new
preses of the Royal Society. Tea, coffee, and bread and butter, which is
poor work. Certainly a slice of ham, a plate of shrimps, some broiled
fish, or a mutton chop, would have been becoming so learned a body. I
was most kindly received, however, by Dr. D. Gilbert, and a number of
the members. I saw Sir John Sievwright&mdash;a singular personage; he told me
his uniform plan was to support Ministers, but he always found himself
voting in <a name="Page_174"></a>Opposition. I told him his deference to Ministers was like
that of the Frenchman to the enemy, who, being at his mercy, asked for
his life:&mdash;&quot;Anything in my power excepting that, sir,&quot; said Monsieur.
Sir John has made progress in teaching animals without severity or
beating. I should have liked to have heard him on this topic.</p>

<p>Called at Northumberland House and saw the Duke. According to his report
I lost much by not hearing the two rival nightingales, Sontag and Pasta,
last night, but I care not for it.</p>

<p>Met Sir W. K[nighton], returned from the Continent. He gives me to
understand I will be commanded for Sunday. Sir W.K. asked me to sit for
him to Northcote, and to meet him there at one to-morrow. I cannot
refuse this, but it is a great bore.<a name="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p>Dined with Mrs. Alexander of Ballochmyle, Lord and Lady Meath, who were
kind to us in Ireland, and a Scottish party,&mdash;pleasant, from hearing the
broad accents and honest thoughts of my native land. A large party in
the evening. A gentleman came up to me and asked &quot;if I had seen the
'Casket,' a curious work, the most beautiful, the most highly
ornamented&mdash;and then the editor or editress&mdash;a female so
interesting,&mdash;might he ask a very great favour,&quot; and out he pulled a
piece of this pic-nic. I was really angry, and said for a subscription
he might command me&mdash;for a contribution no; that I had given to a great
many of these things last year, and finding the labour occupied some
considerable portion of my time, I had done a considerable article for a
<a name="Page_175"></a>single collection this year, taking a valuable consideration for it,
and engaged not to support any other. This may be misrepresented, but I
care not. Suppose this patron of the Muses gives five guineas to his
distressed lady, he will think he does a great deal, yet takes fifty
from me with the calmest air in the world, for the communication is
worth that if it be worth anything. There is no equality in the
proposal.</p>

<p>I saw to-day at Northumberland House, Bridge the jeweller, having and
holding a George, richly ornamented with diamonds, being that which
Queen Anne gave to the Duke of Marlborough, which his present
representative pawned or sold, and which the present king bought and
presented to the Duke of Wellington. His Grace seemed to think this
interesting jewel was one of two which had been preserved since the
first institution of that order. That, from the form and taste, I
greatly doubt. Mr. Bridge put it again into his coat pocket, and walked
through the street with &pound;10,000 in his pocket. I wonder he is not
hustled and robbed. I have sometimes envied rich citizens, but it was a
mean and erroneous feeling. This man, who, I suppose, must be as rich as
a Jew, had a shabby look in the Duke's presence, and seemed just a
better sort of pedlar. Better be a poor gentleman after all.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 9.&mdash;Grounds of Foote's farce of the Cozeners. Lady &mdash;&mdash;. A certain
Mrs. Phipps audaciously set up in a fashionable quarter of the town as a
person through whose influence, properly propitiated, favours and
situations of importance might certainly be obtained&mdash;always for a
consideration. She cheated many people, and maintained the trick for
many months. One trick was to get the equipage of Lord North, and other
persons of importance, to halt before her door as if the owners were
within. With respect to most of them, this was effected by bribing the
drivers. But a gentleman, who watched her closely, observed that Charles
J. Fox actually left his carriage and went into the <a name="Page_176"></a>house, and this
more than once. He was then, it must be noticed, in the Ministry. When
Mrs. Phipps was blown up, this circumstance was recollected as deserving
explanation, which Fox readily gave at Brooks's and elsewhere. It seems
Mrs. Phipps had the art to persuade him that she had the disposal of
what was then called a hy&aelig;na&mdash;that is, an heiress&mdash;an immense Jamaica
heiress, in whom she was willing to give or sell her interest to Charles
Fox. Without having perfect confidence in the obliging proposal, the
great statesman thought the thing worth looking after, and became so
earnest in it, that Mrs. Phipps was desirous to back out of it for fear
of discovery. With this view she made confession one fine morning, with
many professions of the deepest feelings, that the hy&aelig;na had proved a
frail monster, and given birth to a girl or boy&mdash;no matter which. Even
this did not make Charles quit chase of the hy&aelig;na. He intimated that if
the cash was plenty and certain, the circumstance might be overlooked.
Mrs. Phipps had nothing for it but to double the disgusting dose. &quot;The
poor child,&quot; she said, &quot;was unfortunately of a mixed colour, somewhat
tinged with the blood of Africa; no doubt Mr. Fox was himself very dark,
and the circumstance might not draw attention,&quot; etc. etc. This singular
anecdote was touched upon by Foote, and is the cause of introducing the
negress into the <i>Cozeners</i>,<a name="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> though no express allusion to Charles
Fox was admitted. Lady &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; tells me that, in her youth, the laugh was
universal so soon as the black woman appeared. It is one of the numerous
hits that will be lost to posterity. Jack Fuller, celebrated for his
attempt on the Speaker's wig, told me he was editing Foote, but I think
he has hardly taste enough. He told me Colman was to be his
assistant.<a name="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_177"></a>
<p>Went down in the morning to Montagu House, where I found the Duke going
out to suffer a recovery.<a name="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> I had some fancy to see the ceremony, but
more to get my breakfast, which I took at a coffee-house at Charing
Cross.</p>

<p>I sat to Northcote, who is to introduce himself in the same piece in the
act of painting me, like some pictures of the Venetian school. The
artist is an old man, low in stature, and bent with years&mdash;fourscore at
least. But the eye is quick and the countenance noble. A pleasant
companion, familiar with recollections of Sir Joshua, Samuel Johnson,
Burke, Goldsmith, etc. His account of the last confirms all that we have
heard of his oddities.</p>

<p>Dined with Mr. Arbuthnot, where met Duke of Rutland, Lord and Lady
Londonderry, etc. etc. Went to hear Mrs. Arkwright at Lady Charlotte
Greville's. Lockhart came home to-day.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 10.&mdash;Another long sitting to the old Wizard Northcote. He really
resembles an animated mummy.<a name="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> He has altered my ideas of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, whom, from the expressions used by Goldsmith, Johnson, and
others, I used to think an amiable and benevolent character. But though
not void of generosity, he was cold, unfeeling, and indifferent to his
family: so much so that his sister, Miss Reynolds, after expressing her
wonder at the general acceptance which Sir Joshua met with in society,
concluded with, &quot;For me, I only see in him a dark gloomy tyrant.&quot; I own
this view of his character hurt me, by depriving me of the pleasing
vision of the highest talents united with the kindest temper. But
Northcote says his disagreeable points were rather negative than
positive&mdash;more a want of feeling than any <a name="Page_178"></a>desire to hurt or tyrannise.
They arose from his exclusive attachment to art.</p>

<p>Dined with a pleasant party at Lord Gower's. Lady Gower is a beautiful
woman, and extremely courteous. Mrs. Arkwright was of the party. I am
getting well acquainted with her, and think I can see a great deal of
sense mixed with her accomplishment.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 11.&mdash;Breakfasted with Dr. Maltby, preacher in Lincoln's Inn. He
was to have been the next Bishop, if the Whigs had held their ground.
His person, manners, and attainments would have suited the lawn sleeves
well. I heard service in the chapel, which is a very handsome place of
worship; it is upstairs, which seems extraordinary, and the space
beneath forms cloisters, in which the ancient Benchers of this Society
of Lincoln's Inn are entered. I met my old friend Sir William
Grant,<a name="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> and had some conversation with him. Dr. Maltby gave us a
good sermon upon the introduction of the Gospel. There was only one
monument in the chapel, a handsome tablet to the memory of Perceval. The
circumstance that it was the only monument in the chapel of a society
which had produced so many men of talents and distinction was
striking&mdash;it was a tribute due to the suddenness of his strange
catastrophe. There is nothing very particular in the hall of Lincoln's
Inn, nor its parlour, which are like those of a college. Indeed the
whole establishment has a monastic look.</p>

<p>Sat to Northcote, who only requires (<i>Deo gratias</i>) another sitting.
Dined with his Majesty in a very private party&mdash;five or six only being
present. I was received most kindly as usual. It is impossible to
conceive a more friendly manner than his Majesty used towards me. I
spoke to S.W.K. about the dedication of the collected works, and he says
it will be highly well taken.<a name="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="Page_179"></a>I went after the party broke up to Mrs. Scott of Harden, where I made
acquaintance with her beautiful kinswoman, Lady Sarah Ponsonby, whose
countenance is really seraphic and totally devoid of affectation.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 12.&mdash;Old George II. was, as is well known, extremely passionate.
On these occasions his small stock of English totally failed him, and he
used to express his indignation in the following form: &quot;G&mdash;d&mdash;n me, who
I am? Got d&mdash;n you, who you be?&quot; Lockhart and I visited a Mrs.
Quillinan,<a name="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> with whom Wordsworth and his wife have pitched their
tent. I was glad to see my old friend, whose conversation has so much
that is fresh and manly in it. I do not at all acquiesce in his system
of poetry, and I think he has injured his own fame by adhering to it.
But a better or more sensible man I do not know than W.W.</p>

<p>Afterwards Lockhart and I called on Miss Nicolson, and from thence I
wandered down into that immense hash of a city to see Heath, and
fortunately caught hold on him. All this made me too late for
Northcote,&mdash;who was placable, however.<a name="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p>Dined at Sir John Shelley's, <i>&agrave; petit couvert</i>. Here were the Duke of
Wellington, Duke of Rutland, and only one or two more, particularly Mr.
and Mrs. Arbuthnot. The evening was very pleasant, and did not break up
till twelve at night.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 13.&mdash;Breakfasted with Sir George Philips&mdash;there was Sydney Smith,
full of fun and spirit, and his daughter, <a name="Page_180"></a>who is a good-humoured
agreeable girl. We had a pleasant breakfast party.</p>

<p>The Catholics have carried their question, which I suppose will be
thrown out in the Lords. I think they had better concede this
oft-disputed point, and dissolve the league which binds so many people
in opposition to Government. It is a matter of great consequence that
men should not acquire the habit of opposing. No earthly advantage would
arise to Ireland from ceding what is retained, where so much has been
already yielded up. Indeed the Catholic gentry do not pretend that the
granting the immunities they require would tranquillise the country, but
only that it would remove from men of honour all pretext for
countenancing them. This is on the principle of the solicitor of the
unhappy Rajah Nuncomar, who after extorting as much money as he could,
under pretence of bribing persons to procure his pardon, facilitate his
escape, etc., found himself pressed by his victim for a final answer.
&quot;The preparations for death are ready,&quot; said the Rajah; &quot;I fear,
notwithstanding all you have told me, their intention is to take my
life.&quot; &quot;By G&mdash;d,&quot; replied the trusty solicitor, &quot;if they do I will never
forgive them.&quot; So if there are further disturbances after the Catholic
claims are granted, I suppose those by whom they are now advocated will
never forgive their friends the Pats; and that will be all John Bull
will get for it. I dined with Lady Stafford, for whom I have much
regard. I recollect her ever since she stood at her aunt Lady
Glenorchy's window, in George Square, reviewing her regiment of
Sutherland giants. She was, as she ever is, most attentive and kind.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 14.&mdash;I carried Lockhart to Lady Francis Gower's to hear Mrs.
Arkwright sing, and I think he admired her as much as his nature permits
him to love anything musical, for he certainly is not quickly moved by
concord of sweet sounds. I do not understand them better than he, but
<a name="Page_181"></a>the <i>voce del petto</i> always affects me, and Mrs. A. has it in
perfection. I have received as much pleasure from that lady's music as
sound could ever give me.<a name="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> Lockhart goes off for Brighton. I had a
round of men in office. I waited on the Duke at Downing St., and I think
put L. right there, if he will look to himself. But I can only tee the
ball; he must strike the blow with the golf club himself. I saw Mr.
Renton, and he promised to look after Harper's business favourably. Good
gracious, what a solicitor we are grown!</p>

<p>Dined with Lady Davy&mdash;a pleasant party; but I was out of spirits; I
think partly on Johnnie's account, partly from fatigue. There was
William Henry Lyttelton amongst others; much of his oddity has rubbed
off, and he is an honoured courtly gentleman, with a great deal of wit;
and not one of the fine people who perplex you by shutting their mouths
if you begin to speak. I never fear quizzing, so am not afraid of this
species of lying-in-wait. Lord have mercy on me if I were!</p>

<p><i>May</i> 15.&mdash;Dined at the Roxburghe Club. Lord Spencer presided, but had a
cold which limited his exertions. Lord Clive, beside whom I sat, was
deaf, though intelligent and good-humoured. The Duke of Devonshire was
still deafer. There were many little chirruping men who might have
talked but went into committee. There was little general conversation. I
should have mentioned that I breakfasted with kind, good Mr. Hughes, and
met the Bishop of Llandaff&mdash;strongly intelligent. I do not understand
his politics about the Catholic question. He seems disposed to concede,
yet is Toryissimus. Perhaps they wish the question ended, but the
present opinions of the Sovereign are too much interested to permit them
to quit it.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 16.&mdash;Breakfasted with Mr. Reynolds; a miscellaneous party.
Wordsworth, right welcome unto me was <a name="Page_182"></a>there. I had also a sight of
Godwin the philosopher, grown old and thin&mdash;of Douglas Kinnaird, whom I
asked about Byron's statue, which is going forward&mdash;of Luttrell, and
others whom I knew not. I stayed an instant at Pickering's, a young
publisher's, and bought some dramatic reprints. I love them very much,
but I would [not] advise a young man to undertake them. They are of
course dear, and as they have not the dignity of scarcity, the
bibliomaniacs pass them by as if they were plated candlesticks. They may
hold as good a light for all that as if they were real silver, and
therefore I buy them when I can light on them. But here I am spending
money when I have more need to make it. On Monday, the 26th, it shall be
Northward ho!</p>

<p>Dined at Lady Georgiana and Mr. Agar Ellis's.<a name="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> There were Lord and
Lady Stafford there, and others to whom I am sincerely attached.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 17.&mdash;A day of busy idleness. Richardson came and breakfasted with
me like a good fellow. Then I went to Mr. Chantrey, and sat for an hour
to finish the bust.<a name="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> Thereafter, about twelve o'clock, I went to
breakfast the second, at Lady Shelley's, where there was a great morning
party. A young lady<a name="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> begged a lock of my hair, which was not worth
refusing. I stipulated for a kiss, which I was permitted to take. From
this I went to the Duke of Wellington, who gave me some hints or rather
details. Afterwards I drove out to Chiswick, where I had never been
before. A numerous and gay party were assembled to walk and enjoy the
beauties of that Palladian [dome?]; the place and highly ornamented
gardens belonging to it resemble a <a name="Page_183"></a>picture of Watteau. There is some
affectation in the picture, but in the <i>ensemble</i> the original looked
very well. The Duke of Devonshire received every one with the best
possible manners. The scene was dignified by the presence of an immense
elephant, who, under charge of a groom, wandered up and down, giving an
air of Asiatic pageantry to the entertainment. I was never before
sensible of the dignity which largeness of size and freedom of movement
give to this otherwise very ugly animal. As I was to dine at Holland
House, I did not partake in the magnificent repast which was offered to
us, and took myself off about five o'clock. I contrived to make a
demi-toilette at Holland House rather than drive all the way to London.
Rogers came to dinner, which was very entertaining. The Duke of
Manchester was there, whom I remember having seen long ago. He had left
a part of his brain in Jamaica by a terrible fracture, yet,
notwithstanding the accident and the bad climate, was still a
fine-looking man. Lady Holland<a name="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> pressed me to stay all night, which
I did accordingly.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 18.&mdash;The freshness of the air, the singing of the birds, the
beautiful aspect of nature, the size of the venerable trees, all gave me
a delightful feeling this morning. It seemed there was pleasure even in
living and breathing, without anything else. We (<i>i.e.</i> Rogers and I)
wandered into a green lane bordered with fine trees, which might have
been twenty miles from a town. It will be a great pity when this ancient
house must come down and give way to brick works and brick-houses. It is
not that Holland House is fine as a building; on the contrary, it has a
tumble-down look; and, although decorated with the bastard Gothic of
James I.'s time, the front is heavy. But it resembles many <a name="Page_184"></a>respectable
matrons, who, having been absolutely ugly during youth, acquire by age
an air of dignity;&mdash;though one is chiefly affected by the air of deep
seclusion which is spread around the domain. I called on Mr. Peel as I
returned home, and after that on Lord Melville. The latter undertook for
Allan Cunningham's son's cadetship, for which I am right glad.</p>

<p>Dined at Mr. and Lady Sarah Ponsonby's, who called on us last year at
Abbotsford. The party was very pleasant, having Lord and Lady Gower,
whom I like, Mr. and Lady Georgiana Ellis, and other persons of
distinction. Saw Wordsworth too, and learned that Tom Moore was come to
town.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 19.&mdash;A morning of business. Breakfasted with Dumergue and one or
two friends. Dined by command with the Duchess of Kent. I was very
kindly recognised by Prince Leopold. I was presented to the little
Princess Victoria,&mdash;I hope they will change her name,&mdash;the heir apparent
to the Crown as things now stand. How strange that so large and fine a
family as that of his late Majesty should have died off and decayed into
old age with so few descendants! Prince George of Cumberland is, they
say, a fine boy about nine years old&mdash;a bit of a pickle, swears and
romps like a brat that has been bred in a barrack yard. This little lady
is educated with much care, and watched so closely by the Duchess and
the principal governess, that no busy maid has a moment to whisper, &quot;You
are heir of England.&quot; I suspect if we could dissect the little head, we
should find that some pigeon or other bird of the air had carried the
matter. She is fair, like the Royal Family, but does not look as if she
would be pretty. The Duchess herself is very pleasing and affable in her
manners. I sat by Mr. Spring Rice, a very agreeable man. He is a great
leader among the Pro-Catholics. I saw also Charles Wynn and his
lady&mdash;and the evening, for a Court evening, went <a name="Page_185"></a>agreeably off. I am
commanded for two days by Prince Leopold, but will send excuses.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 20.&mdash;I set out for Brighton this morning in a light coach, which
performed the distance in six hours&mdash;otherwise the journey was
uncomfortable. Three women, the very specimens of womankind,&mdash;I mean
trumpery,&mdash;a child who was sick, but afterwards looked and smiled, and
was the only thing like company. The road is pleasant enough till it
gets into the Wealds of Sussex, a huge succession of green downs which
sweep along the sea-coast for many miles. Brighton seems grown twice as
large since 1815. It is a city of loiterers and invalids&mdash;a Vanity Pair
for pipers, dancing of bears, and for the feats of Mr. Punch. I found
all my family well excepting the poor pale Johnnie; and he is really a
thing to break one's heart by looking at&mdash;yet he is better. The rest are
in high kelter.</p>

<p>My old friend Will Rose dined with us, also a Doctor Yates and his
wife&mdash;the Esculapius of Brighton, who seems a sensible man. I was
entertained with the empire he exerted over him as protector of his
health. I was very happy to find myself at Sophia's quiet table, and am
only sorry that I must quit her so soon.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 21.&mdash;This being a fine day, we made some visits in the morning, in
the course of which I waited on Mrs. Davies, sister of Mrs. Charlotte
Smith,<a name="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> and herself the author of the <i>Peacock at Home</i>, one of the
prettiest and liveliest <i>jeux d'esprit</i> in our language. She is a fine
stately old lady&mdash;not a bit of a literary person,&mdash;I mean having none of
the affectation of it, but like a lady of considerable rank. I am glad I
have seen her. Renewed my acquaintance with Lady Charlotte Hamilton,
<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lady Charlotte Hume, and talked over some stories thirty years old
at least. We then took a fly, as they call the light carriages, and
drove as far as the Devil's Ditch. A rampart it is of great strength and
depth, enclosing, I <a name="Page_186"></a>presume, the precincts of a British town that must
have held 30,000 men at least. I could not discover where they got
water.</p>

<p>We got home at four, and dined at five, and smoked cigars till eight.
Will Rose came in with his man Hinvaes,<a name="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> who is as much a piece of
Rose as Trim was of Uncle Toby. We laughed over tales &quot;both old and new&quot;
till ten o'clock came, and then broke up.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 22.&mdash;Left Brighton this morning with a heavy heart. Poor Johnnie
looks so very poorly that I cannot but regard his case as desperate, and
then God help the child's parents! Amen!</p>

<p>We took the whole of one of the post-coaches, and so came rapidly to
town, Sophia coming along with us about a new servant. This enabled me
to dine with Mr. Adolphus, the celebrated barrister, the father to my
young friend who wrote so like a gentleman on my matters.<a name="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> I met Mr.
Gurney, Archdeacon Wrangham, and a lawyer or two besides. I may <a name="Page_187"></a>be
partial, but the conversation of intelligent barristers amuses me more
than that of other professional persons. There is more of real life in
it, with which, in all its phases, people of business get so well
acquainted. Mr. Adolphus is a man of varied information, and very
amusing. He told me a gipsy told him of the success he should have in
life, and how it would be endangered by his own heat of temper,
alluding, I believe, to a quarrel betwixt him and a brother barrister.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 23.&mdash;I breakfasted with Chantrey, and met the celebrated Coke of
Norfolk,<a name="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> a very pleasing man, who gave me some account of his
plantations. I understand from him that, like every wise man, he planted
land that would not let for 5s. per acre, but which now produces &pound;3000 a
year in wood. He talked of the trees which he had planted as being so
thick that a man could not fathom<a name="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> them. Withers, he said, was never
employed save upon one or two small jobs of about twenty acres on which
every expense was bestowed with a view to early growth. So much for
Withers. I shall have a rod in pickle for him if worth while.<a name="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> After
sitting to Chantrey for the last time, I called on Lady Shelley, P.P.C.,
and was sorry to find her worse than she had been. Dined with Lady
Stafford, where I met the two Lochs, John and James. The former gave me
his promise for a cadetship to Allan Cunningham's son; I have a similar
promise from Lord Melville, and thus I am in the situation in which I
have been at Gladdies Wiel,<a name="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> where I have caught two trouts, one
with <a name="Page_188"></a>the fly, the other with the bobber. I have landed both, and so I
will now. Mr. Loch also promised me to get out Shortreed as a free
mariner. Tom Grenville was at dinner.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 24.&mdash;This day we dined at Richmond Park with Lord Sidmouth. Before
dinner his Lordship showed me letters which passed between the great
Lord Chatham and Dr. Addington, Lord Sidmouth's [father]. There was much
of that familiar friendship which arises, and must arise, between an
invalid, the head of an invalid family, and their medical adviser,
supposing the last to be a wise and well-bred man. The character of Lord
Chatham's handwriting is strong and bold, and his expressions short and
manly. There are intimations of his partiality for William, whose health
seems to have been precarious during boyhood. He talks of William
imitating him in all he did, and calling for ale because his father was
recommended to drink it. &quot;If I should smoke,&quot; he said, &quot;William would
instantly call for a pipe;&quot; and, he wisely infers, &quot;I must take care
what I do.&quot; The letters of the late William Pitt are of great curiosity,
but as, like all real letters of business, they only <i>allude</i> to matters
with which his correspondent is well acquainted, and do not enter into
details, they would require an ample commentary. I hope Lord Sidmouth
will supply this, and have urged it as much as I can. I think, though I
hate letters and abominate interference, I will write to him on this
subject.</p>

<p>I have bought a certain quantity of reprints from a bookseller in
Chancery Lane, Pickering by name. I urged him to print the controversy
between Greene and the Harveys. He wished me to write a third part to a
fine edition of Cotton's <i>Angler</i>, for which I am quite
incompetent.<a name="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p>I met at Richmond my old and much esteemed friend Lord Stowell,<a name="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a>
looking very frail and even comatose. <i>Quantum<a name="Page_189"></a> mutatus!</i> He was one of
the pleasantest men I ever knew.</p>

<p>Respecting the letters, I picked up from those of Pitt that he was
always extremely desirous of peace with France, and even reckoned upon
it at a moment when he ought to have despaired. I suspect this false
view of the state of France (for such it was), which induced the British
Minister to look for peace when there was no chance of it, damped his
ardour in maintaining the war. He wanted the lofty ideas of his
father&mdash;you read it in his handwriting, great statesman as he was. I saw
a letter or two of Burke's in which there is an <i>&eacute;panchement du c&#339;ur</i>
not visible in those of Pitt, who writes like a Premier to his
colleague. Burke was under the strange hallucination that his son, who
predeceased him, was a man of greater talents than himself. On the
contrary, he had little talent and no resolution. On moving some
resolutions in favour of the Catholics, which were ill-received by the
House of Commons, young Burke actually ran away, which an Orangeman
compared to a cross-reading in the newspapers:&mdash;Yesterday the Catholic
resolutions were moved, etc., but, the pistol missing fire, the villains
ran off!</p>

<p><i>May</i> 25.&mdash;After a morning of letter-writing, leave-taking, papers
destroying, and God knows what trumpery, Sophia and I set out for
Hampton Court, carrying with us the following lions and
lionesses&mdash;Samuel Rogers, Tom Moore, Wordsworth, with wife and daughter.
We were very kindly and properly received by Walter and his wife, and a
very pleasant party.<a name="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>May</i> 26.&mdash;An awful confusion with paying of bills, <a name="Page_190"></a>writing of cards,
and all species of trumpery business. Southey, who is just come to town,
breakfasted with us. He looks, I think, but poorly, but it may be owing
to family misfortune. One is always tempted to compare Wordsworth and
Southey. The latter is unquestionably the greater scholar&mdash;I mean
possesses the most extensive stock of information, but there is a
freshness, vivacity, and spring about Wordsworth's mind, which, if we
may compare two men of uncommon powers, shows more originality. I say
nothing of their poetry. Wordsworth has a system which disposes him to
take the bull by the horns and offend public taste, which, right or
wrong, will always be the taste of the public; yet he could be popular
if he would,&mdash;witness the Feast at Brougham Castle,&mdash;Song of the
Cliffords, I think, is the name.</p>

<p>I walked down to call, with Rogers, on Mrs. D'Arblay. She showed me some
notes which she was making about her novels, which she induced me to
believe had been recollected and jotted down in compliance with my
suggestions on a former occasion. It is curious how she contrived to get
<i>Evelina</i> printed and published without her father's knowledge. Her
brother placed it in the hands of one Lowndes, who, after its success,
bought it for &pound;20!!! and had the magnanimity to add &pound;10&mdash;the price, I
think, of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. One of her sisters betrayed the secret to her
father, who then eagerly lent his ears to hear what was said of the new
novel, and the first opinion which saluted his delighted ears was the
voice of Johnson energetically recommending it to the perusal of Mrs

<p>At parting, Rogers gave me a gold-mounted pair of <a name="Page_191"></a>glasses, which I will
not part with in a hurry. I really like Rogers, and have always found
him most friendly. After many petty delays we set off at last and
reached Bushy Grove to dine with my kind and worthy family friend and
relative, David Haliburton. I am delighted to find him in all the
enjoyment of life, with the vivacity of youth in his sentiments and
enjoyments. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell Marjoribanks are the only company
here, with Miss Parker.</p>

<p><i>May 27</i>.&mdash;Well, my retreat from London is now accomplished, and I may
fairly balance the advantage and loss of this London trip. It has cost
me a good deal of money, and Johnnie's illness has taken away much of
the pleasure I had promised myself. But if I can judge from the
reception I have met with, I have the pleasure to know that I stand as
fair with the public, and as high with my personal friends, as in any
period of my life. And this has enabled me to forward the following
objects to myself and others:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. I have been able to place Lockhart on the right footing in the
right quarter, leaving the improvement of his place of vantage to
himself as circumstances should occur.</p>

<p>2d. I have put the Chancery suit in the right train, which without me
could not have been done.<a name="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p>3d. I picked up some knowledge of the state of existing matters, which
is interesting and may be useful.</p>

<p>4th. I have succeeded in helping to get a commission for James Skene.</p>

<p>5th. I have got two cadetships for the sons of Allan Cunningham.</p>

<p>6th. I have got leave to Andrew Shortreed to go out to India.</p>

<p>7th. I have put John Eckford into correspondence with Mr. Loch, who
thinks he can do something for his claim.</p>

<p>8th. I have been of material assistance to poor Terry in his affairs.</p>
<a name="Page_192"></a>
<p>9th. I have effectually protected my Darnick neighbours and myself
against the New Road Bill.</p>

<p>Other advantages there are, besides the great one of scouring up one's
own mind a little and renewing intercourse with old friends, bringing
one's-self nearer in short to the currency of the time.</p>

<p>All this may weigh against the expenditure of &pound;200 or &pound;250, when money
is fortunately not very scarce with me.</p>

<p>We went out for a most agreeable drive through the Hertfordshire
Lanes&mdash;a strange intricate combination of narrow roads passing through
the country, winding and turning among oaks and other large timber, just
like pathways cut through a forest. They wind and turn in so singular a
manner, and resemble each other so much, that a stranger would have
difficulty to make way amongst them. We visited Moor Park (not the house
of Sir William Temple, but that where the Duke and Duchess of Monmouth
lived). Having rather a commanding situation, you look down on the
valley, which, being divided into small enclosures bordered with wood,
resembles a forest when so looked down on. The house has a handsome
entrance-hall, painted by Sir James Thornhill, in a very French taste,
yet handsome. He was Hogarth's father-in-law, and not easily reconciled
to the match. Thornhill's paintings are certainly not of the first
class, yet the practice of painting the walls and roof of a
dwelling-house gives, in my eyes, a warm and rich air to the apartments.
Lord Grosvenor has now bought this fine place, once Lord Anson's&mdash;hence
the Moor Park apricot is also called Ansoniana. After seeing Moor Park
we went to the Grove, the Earl of Clarendon's country-seat. The house
looks small and of little consequence, but contains many good portraits,
as I was told, of the Hyde family.<a name="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> The park has fine views and
magnificent trees.</p>
<a name="Page_193"></a>
<p>We went to Cashiobury, belonging to the Earl of Essex, an old mansion,
apparently, with a fine park. The Colne runs through the grounds, or
rather creeps through them.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;For the Colne<br /></span>
<span>Is black and swollen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Snake-like, he winds his way,<br /></span>
<span>Unlike the burns<br /></span>
<span>From Highland urns<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That dance by crag and brae.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Borthwick-brae<a name="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> came to dinner from town, and we had a very pleasant
evening. My excellent old friend reminded me of the old and bitter feud
between the Scotts and the Haliburtons, and observed it was curious I
should have united the blood of two hostile clans.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 28.&mdash;We took leave of our kind old host after breakfast, and set
out for our own land. Our elegant researches carried us out of the
high-road and through a labyrinth of intricate lanes,&mdash;which seem made
on purpose to afford strangers the full benefit of a dark night and a
drunk driver,&mdash;in order to visit Gill's Hill, famous for the murder of
Mr. Weare.</p>

<p>The place has the strongest title to the description of Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;A merry spot, 'tis said, in days of yore,<br /></span>
<span>But something ails it now&mdash;- the place is cursed.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The principal part of the house has been destroyed, and only the kitchen
remains standing. The garden has been dismantled, though a few laurels
and garden shrubs, run wild, continue to mark the spot. The fatal pond
is now only a green swamp, but so near the house that one cannot
conceive how it was ever chosen as a place of temporary concealment of
the murdered body. Indeed the whole history of the murder, and the
scenes which ensued, are strange pictures of desperate and short-sighted
wickedness. The feasting&mdash;the <a name="Page_194"></a>singing&mdash;the murderer with his hands
still bloody hanging round the neck of one of the females&mdash;the
watch-chain of the murdered man, argue the utmost apathy. Even Probert,
the most frightened of the party, fled no further for relief than to the
brandy bottle, and is found in the very lane, and at the spot of the
murder, seeking for the murderous weapon, and exposing himself to the
view of the passengers. Another singular mark of stupid audacity was
their venturing to wear the clothes of their victim. There was a want of
foresight in the whole arrangement of the deed, and the attempts to
conceal it, which argued strange inconsideration, which a professed
robber would not have exhibited. There was just one single shade of
redeeming character about a business so brutal, perpetrated by men above
the very lowest rank of life&mdash;it was the mixture of revenge which
afforded some relief to the circumstances of treachery and premeditation
which accompanied it. But Weare was a cheat, and had no doubt pillaged
Thurtell, who therefore deemed he might take greater liberties with him
than with others.</p>

<p>The dirt of the present habitation equalled its wretched desolation, and
a truculent-looking hag, who showed us the place, and received
half-a-crown, looked not unlike the natural inmate of such a mansion.
She indicated as much herself, saying the landlord had dismantled the
place because no respectable person would live there. She seems to live
entirely alone, and fears no ghosts, she says.</p>

<p>One thing about this mysterious tragedy was never explained. It is said
that Weare, as is the habit of such men, always carried about his
person, and between his flannel waistcoat and shirt, a sum of ready
money, equal to &pound;1500 or &pound;2000. No such money was ever recovered, and as
the sum divided by Thurtell among his accomplices was only about &pound;20, he
must, in slang phrase, have <i>bucketed his pals</i>.<a name="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_195"></a>
<p>We came on as far as Alconbury, where we slept comfortably.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 29.&mdash;We travelled from Alconbury Hill to Ferry Bridge, upwards of
a hundred miles, amid all the beauties of &quot;flourish&quot; and verdure which
spring awakens at her first approach in the midland counties of England,
but without any variety save those of the season's making. I do believe
this great north road is the dullest in the world, as well as the most
convenient for the traveller. Nothing seems to me to have been altered
within twenty or thirty years, save the noses of the landlords, which
have bloomed and given place to another set of proboscises as germane us
the old ones to the <i>very welcome</i>,&mdash;<i>please to light</i>&mdash;<i>'Orses
forward,</i> and <i>ready out</i>. The skeleton at Barnby Moor has deserted his
gibbet, and that is the only change I recollect.</p>

<p>I have amused myself to-day with reading Lockhart's <i>Life of Burns</i>,
which is very well written&mdash;in fact, an admirable thing. He has
judiciously slurred over his vices and follies; for although Currie, I
myself, and others, have not said a word more on that subject than is
true, yet as the dead corpse is straightened, swathed, and made decent,
so ought the character of such an inimitable genius as Burns to be
tenderly handled after death. The knowledge of his vicious weaknesses or
vices is only a subject of sorrow to the well-disposed, and of triumph
to the profligate.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 30.&mdash;We left Ferry Bridge at seven, and turning westwards, or
rather northwestward, at Borough Bridge, we roach Rokeby at past three.
A mile from the house we met Morritt looking for us. I had great
pleasure at finding myself at Rokeby, and recollecting a hundred
passages of past time. Morritt looks well and easy in his mind, which I
am delighted to see. He is now one of my oldest, and, I believe, one of
my most sincere, friends, a man unequalled in the mixture of sound good
sense, high literary cultivation, and the kindest and sweetest temper
that ever graced a human bosom.<a name="Page_196"></a> His nieces are much attached to him,
and are deserving and elegant, as well as beautiful young women. What
there is in our partiality to female beauty that commands a species of
temperate homage from the aged, as well as ecstatic admiration from the
young, I cannot conceive, but it is certain that a very large proportion
of some other amiable quality is too little to counterbalance the
absolute want of this advantage. I, to whom beauty is and shall
henceforth be a picture, still look upon it with the quiet devotion of
an old worshipper, who no longer offers incense on the shrine, but
peaceably presents his inch of taper, taking special care in doing so
not to burn his own fingers. Nothing in life can be more ludicrous or
contemptible than an old man aping the passions of his youth.</p>

<p>Talking of youth, there was a certain professor at Cambridge who used to
keep sketches of all the youths who, from their conduct at college,
seemed to bid fair for distinction in life. He showed them, one day, to
an old shrewd sarcastic Master of Arts, who looked over the collection,
and then observed, &quot;A promising nest of eggs; what a pity the great part
will turn out addle!&quot; And so they do; looking round amongst the young
men, one sees to all appearance fine flourish&mdash;but it ripens not.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 31.&mdash;I have finished Napier's <i>War in the Peninsula</i>.<a name="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> It is
written in the spirit of a Liberal, but the narrative is distinct and
clear, and I should suppose accurate. He has, however, given a bad
sample of accuracy in the case of Lord Strangford, where his pointed
affirmation has been as pointedly repelled. It is evident he would
require probing. His defence of Moore is spirited and well argued,
though it is evident he defends the statesman as much as the general. As
a Liberal and a military man, Colonel Napier finds it difficult to steer
his course. The former character calls on <a name="Page_197"></a>him to plead for the
insurgent Spaniards; the latter induces him to palliate the cruelties of
the French. Good-even to him until next volume, which I shall long to
see. This was a day of pleasure and nothing else. After breakfast I
walked with Morritt in the new path he has made up the Tees. When last
here, his poor nephew was of the party. It hangs on my mind, and perhaps
on Morritt's. When we returned we took a short drive as far as Barnard
Castle; and the business of eating and drinking took up the remainder of
the evening, excepting a dip into the Greta Walk.</p><a name="Page_198"></a>





<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="JUNE_1828"></a><h2>JUNE.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>June</i> 1.&mdash;We took leave of our friends at Rokeby after breakfast, and
pursued our well-known path over Stanmore to Brough, Appleby, Penrith,
and Carlisle. As I have this road by heart, I have little amusement save
the melancholy task of recalling the sensations with which I have traced
it in former times, all of which refer to decay of animal strength, and
abatement if not of mental powers, at least of mental energy. The <i>non
est tanti</i> grows fast at my time of life. We reached Carlisle at seven
o'clock, and were housed for the night. My books being exhausted, I
lighted on an odd volume of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, a work in which,
as in a pawnbroker's shop, much of real curiosity and value are stowed
away and concealed amid the frippery and trumpery of those reverend old
gentlewomen who were the regular correspondents of the work.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 2.&mdash;We intended to walk to the Castle, but were baffled by rainy
weather. I was obliged to wait for a certificate from the parish
register&mdash;<i>Hei mihi</i>!! I cannot have it till ten o'clock, or rather, as
it chanced, till past eleven, when I got the paper for which I
waited.<a name="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> We <a name="Page_199"></a>lunched at Hawick, and concluded our pilgrimage at
Abbotsford about nine at night, where the joyful barking of the dogs,
with the sight of the kind familiar faces of our domestics, gave us
welcome, and I enjoyed a sound repose on my own bed. I remark that in
this journey I have never once experienced depression of spirits, or the
<i>tremor cordis</i> of which I have sometimes such unpleasant visits.
Dissipation, and a succession of trifling engagements, prevent the mind
from throwing itself out in the manner calculated to exhaust the owner,
and to entertain other people. There is a lesson in this.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 3, [<i>Abbotsford</i>].&mdash;This was a very idle day. I waked to walk
about my beautiful young woods with old Tom and the dogs. The sun shone
bright, and the wind fanned my cheek as if it were a welcoming. I did
not do the least right thing, except packing a few books necessary for
writing the continuation of the Tales. In this merry mood I wandered as
far as Huntly Burn, where I found the Miss Fergusons well and happy;
then I sauntered back to Abbotsford, sitting on every bench by the way,
and thus</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;It grew to dinner in conclusion.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A good appetite made my simple meal relish better than the magnificent
cheer which I have lately partaken of. I smoked a cigar, slept away an
hour, and read Mure of Auchendrane's trial, and thus ended the day. I
cannot afford to spend many such, nor would they seem so pleasant.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 4, [<i>Edinburgh</i>].&mdash;The former part of this day was employed much
as yesterday, but some packing was inevitable. Will Laidlaw came to
dinner, of which we partook at three o'clock. Started at half-past four,
and arrived at home, if we must call it so, at nine o'clock in the
evening. I employed my leisure in the chaise to peruse Mure of
Auchen<a name="Page_200"></a>drane's trial, out of which something might be coopered up for
the public.<a name="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> It is one of the wildest stories I ever read. Something
might surely be twisted out of it.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 5.&mdash;Cadell breakfasted; in great spirits with the success of the
<i>Fair Maid of Perth</i>. A disappointment being always to be apprehended, I
too am greatly pleased that the evil day is adjourned, for the time must
come&mdash;and yet I can spin a tough yarn still with any one now going.</p>

<p>I was much distressed to find that the last of the Macdonald Buchanans,
a fine lad of about twenty-one, is now decidedly infected by the same
pulmonary complaint which carried off his four brothers in succession.
This is indeed a cruel stroke, and it is melancholy to witness the
undaunted Highland courage of the father.</p>

<p>I went to Court, and when I returned did some work upon the Tales.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And now again, boys, to the oar.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>June</i> 6.&mdash;I have determined to work sans intermission for lost time,
and to make up at least my task every day. J. Gibson called on me with
good hopes that the trustees will authorise the <i>grand opus</i> to be set
afloat.<a name="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> They are scrupulous a little about the expense of
engravings, but I fear the taste of the town will not be satisfied
without them. It is time these things were settled. I wrought both
before and after dinner, and finished five pages, which is two above
bargain.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 7.&mdash;Saturday was another working day, and nothing occurred to
disturb me.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 8.&mdash;I finished five sheets this day. Will Clerk and Francis Scott
of Harden came to dinner, and we spent a pleasant evening.</p>
<a name="Page_201"></a>
<p><i>June</i> 9.&mdash;I laboured till about one, and was then obliged to go to
attend a meeting of the Oil Gas Company,&mdash;as I devoutly hope for the
last time.</p>

<p>After that I was obliged to go to sit to Colvin Smith, which is an
atrocious bore, but cannot be helped.<a name="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p>Cadell rendered me report of accounts paid for me with vouchers, which
very nearly puts me out of all shop debts. God grant me grace to keep
so!</p>

<p><i>June</i> 10-14.&mdash;During these five days almost nothing occurred to
diversify the ordinary task of the day, which, I must own, was dull
enough. I rose to my task by seven, and, less or more, wrought it out in
the course of the day, far exceeding the ordinary average of three
leaves per day. I have attended the Parliament House with the most
strict regularity, and returned to dine alone with Anne. Also, I gave
three sittings to Mr. Colvin Smith, who I think has improved since I saw
him.</p>

<p>Of important intelligence nothing occurs save the termination of all
suspense on the subject of poor James Macdonald Buchanan. He died at
Malta. The celebrated Dugald Stewart is also dead, famous for his
intimate acquaintance with the history and philosophy of the human mind.
There is much of water-painting in all metaphysics, which consist rather
of words than ideas. But Stewart was most impressive and eloquent. In
former days I was frequently with him, but not for many years. Latterly,
I am told, he had lost not the power of thinking, but the power of
expressing his thoughts by speech. This is like the Metamorphosis of
Ovid, the bark binding in and hardening the living flesh.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 15.&mdash;W. Clerk, Francis Scott, and Charles Sharpe dined with me,
but my task had been concluded before dinner.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 16.&mdash;Dined at Dalmahoy, with the young Earl and Countess of
Morton. I like these young noble folks par<a name="Page_202"></a>ticularly well. Their manners
and style of living are easy and unaffected, and I should like to see
them often. Came home at night. The task finished to-day. I should
mention that the plan about the new edition of the novels was considered
at a meeting of trustees, and finally approved of. I trust it will
answer; yet, who can warrant the continuance of popularity? Old
Corri,<a name="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a> who entered into many projects, and could never set the
sails of a wind-mill so as to catch the <i>aura popularis</i>, used to say
that he believed that were he to turn baker, it would put bread out of
fashion. I have had the better luck to dress my sails to every wind; and
so blow on, good wind, and spin round, whirligig.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 17.&mdash;Violent rheumatic headache all day. Wrought, however. But
what difference this troublesome addition may make on the quality of the
stuff produced, truly I do not know. I finished five leaves.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 18.&mdash;Some Italian gentlemen landed here, under the conveyance of
the Misses Haig of Bemerside. They were gentlemanlike men; but as I did
not dare to speak bad French, I had not much to say to foreigners. Gave
them and their pretty guides a good breakfast, however. The scene seemed
to me to resemble Sheridan's scene in the <i>Critic</i>.<a name="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> There are a
number of very civil gentlemen trying to make themselves understood, and
I do not know which is the interpreter. After all, it is not my fault.
They who wish to see me should be able to speak my language. I called on
Mrs. Stewart Mackenzie. She received me with all the kindness of former
days, and I was delighted to see her. I sat about an hour with her. My
head aches, for all that, and I have heavy fits of drowsiness. Well, I
have finished my task, and have a right to sleep if I have a mind.</p>

<p><a name="Page_203"></a>I dine to-day with Lord Mackenzie, where I hope to meet Mrs. Stewart
Mackenzie again, for I love her warm heart and lively fancy. Accordingly
I enjoyed this pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>June</i> 19.&mdash;Scribbled away lustily. Went to the P.H. Wrote when I came
home, both before and after dinner&mdash;that's all, I think. I am become a
sort of writing automaton, and truly the joints of my knees, especially
the left, are so stiff and painful in rising and sitting down, that I
can hardly help screaming&mdash;I that was so robust and active; I get into a
carriage with great difficulty. My head, too, is bothered with rheumatic
headaches. Why not? I got headaches by my folly when I was young, and
now I am old they come uncalled. Infirmity gives what indiscretion
bought.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 20.&mdash;My course is still the same. But I have a painful letter
from Lockhart, which takes away the last hope of poor Johnnie's
recovery. It is no surprise to me. The poor child, so amiable in its
disposition, and so promising from its talents, was not formed to be
long with us, and I have long expected that it must needs come to this.
I hope I shall not outlive my children in other cases, and I think there
is little chance of it. My father did not long survive the threescore
and ten; it will be wonderful if I reach that goal of ordinary
mortality. God send it may find me prepared; and, whatever I may have
been formerly, high spirits are not now like to carry me away.</p>

<p><i>June</i>, 21.&mdash;At Court, and called on Ballantyne on my <a name="Page_204"></a>return. I was
obliged to go to the Register Office at one, where I waited nearly an
hour without meeting my brethren. But I wrote a letter to Lockhart in
the meantime. My niece Ann arrived, to my great satisfaction. I am glad
that Anne, my daughter, has such a sensible and clever companion. Dined
at Baron Hume's.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 22.&mdash;Wrought. Had a note from Ballantyne complaining of my
manuscript, and requesting me to read it over. I would give &pound;1000 if I
could; but it would take me longer to read than to write. I cannot trace
my <i>pieds de mouche</i> but with great labour and trouble; so e'en take
your own share of the burden, my old friend; and, since I cannot read,
be thankful I can write. I will look at his proof, however, and then be
quiet and idle for the rest of the evening. I am come to Charles the
First's trial, and though I have it by heart, I must refresh myself with
a reading of Clarendon. Charles Sharpe and Francis Scott came in the
evening.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 23.&mdash;This morning the two Annes and I went to Sir Robert Liston
at Milburn Tower&mdash;a beautiful retreat. The travels of the venerable
diplomatist are indicated by the various articles of curiosity which he
has picked up in different corners of the world, and put together with
much taste. The conservatory and gardens are very fine, and contain, I
suppose, very curious plants;&mdash;I am sure, hard names enough. But then
the little Gothic tower, embowered amid trees and bushes, surrounded by
these pleasant gardens, offering many a sunny walk for winter, many a
shade for summer, are inexpressibly pleasing. The good old knight and
his lady are worthy of it, for they enjoy it. The artificial piece of
water is a failure, like most things of the kind. The offices, without
being on an extravagant scale, are most substantial; the piggery, in
particular, is quite a palace, and the animals clean and comfortable. I
think I have caught from them a fit of piggish obstinacy. I came at one,
and cannot prevail upon myself to go to work. I <a name="Page_205"></a>answer the calls of
duty as Caliban does those of Prospero, &quot;There's wood enough within.&quot; To
be sure, I have not got the Clarendon.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 24.&mdash;It was my father's own son, as John Hielandman said, who did
little both yesterday and to-day&mdash;I mean little in the way of literary
work, for, as to positive work, I have been writing letters about
Chancery business till I am sick of it. There was a long <i>hearing</i>, and
while Jeffrey exerted his eloquence in the Inner House, I plied my
eloquence <i>de billet</i> in the Library. So, on the whole, I am no bad boy.
Besides, the day is not yet over.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 25.&mdash;I was surprised to hear that our Academy Rector, Williams,
has renounced the chair of Roman learning in the new London University.
His alarm was excited by the interest taken by the prelates in opposing
a High Church institution to that desired by Mr. Brougham. Both the
Bishops and Williams have been unwise. The former have manoeuvred ill.
They should, in the outset, have taken the establishment out of the
hands of the Whigs, without suffering them to reinforce themselves by
support from [others]. And Williams was equally precipitate in joining
an institution which a small degree of foresight might have assured him
would be opposed by his spiritual superiors. However, there he stands,
deprived of his professorship by his resignation, and of his rectorship
by our having engaged with a successor. I think it very doubtful whether
the Bishops will now [admit] him into their alliance. He has in that
case offended both parties. But if they are wise, they will be glad to
pick up the best schoolmaster in Europe, though he comes for the present
<i>Grai&acirc; ex urbe</i>. I accomplished more than my task to-day.</p>

<p><i>June</i>, 26.&mdash;Wrote a long letter to Lockhart about Williams' situation,
saying how, by sitting betwixt two stools, he</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;- Had fallen with heavy thump<br /></span>
<span>Upon his reverential rump,&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a name="Page_206"></a>and how the Bishops should pick him up if they wanted their
establishment to succeed. It is an awkward position in which Williams
has placed himself. He loses the Whig chair, and has perhaps no chance
of favour from the High Church for having been willing to accept it.
Even if they now give him promotion, there will be a great outcry on his
having left one institution to join another. He would be thick-skinned
if he stands the clamour. Yet he has to all appearance rather sacrificed
than advanced his interest. However, I say again, the Bishops ought not
to omit securing him.</p>

<p>Mr. Macintosh Mackay breakfasted with me, modest, intelligent, and
gentle. I did my duty and more in the course of the day.</p>

<p>I am vexed about Mackay missing the church of Cupar in Angus. It is in
the Crown's gift, and Peel, finding that two parties in the town
recommended two opposite candidates, very wisely chose to disappoint
them both, and was desirous of bestowing the presentation on public
grounds. I heard of this, and applied to Mr. Peel for Macintosh Mackay,
whose quiet patience and learning are accompanied by a most excellent
character as a preacher and a clergyman, but unhappily Mr. Peel had
previously put himself into the hands of Sir George Murray, who applied
to Sir Peter his brother, who naturally applied to certain leaders of
the Church at Edinburgh, and these reverend gentlemen have recommended
that the church which the minister desired to fill up on public grounds
should be bestowed on a boy,<a name="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> the nephew of one of their number, of
whom the best that can be said is that nothing is known, since he has
only been a few months in orders. This comes of kith, kin, and ally, but
Peel shall know of it, and may perhaps judge for himself another time.</p>
<a name="Page_207"></a>
<p><i>June</i> 27.&mdash;I came out after Court to Blair Adam, with our excellent
friend the Rev. John Thomson of Duddingston, so modest and so
accomplished;&mdash;delightful drive and passage at the ferry. We found at
Blair Adam the C.C. and family, Admiral Adam and lady, James Thomson of
Charlton, and Miss T., Will Clerk, and last, not least, Lord Chief Baron
Shepherd&mdash;all in high spirits for our excursions.</p>

<p>Thomson described to me a fine dungeon in the old tower at Cassillis in
Ayrshire. There is an outer and inner vaulted [chamber], each secured
with iron doors. At the upper end of the innermost are two great stones
or blocks to which the staples and chains used in securing the prisoners
are still attached. Between these stone seats is an opening like the
mouth of a still deeper dungeon. The entrance descends like the mouth of
a draw-well or shaft of a mine, and deep below is heard the sullen roar
of the river Doon, one branch of which, passing through the bottom of
the shaft, has probably swept away the body of many a captive, whose
body after death may have been thus summarily disposed of. I may find
use for such a place&mdash;Story of [<i>Kittleclarkie</i>?]</p>

<p><i>June</i> 28.&mdash;Off we go to Castle Campbell after breakfast, <i>i.e.</i> Will
Clerk, Admiral Adam, J. Thomson, and myself. Tremendous hot is the day,
and the steep ascent of the Castle, which rises for two miles up a
rugged and broken path, was fatiguing enough, yet not so much so as the
streets in London. Castle Campbell is unaltered; the window, of which
the disjointed stone projects at an angle from the wall, and seems at
the point of falling, has still found power to resist the laws of
gravitation. Whoever built that tottering piece of masonry has been long
in a forgotten grave, and yet what he has made seems to survive in spite
of nature itself. The curious cleft called Kemp's Score, which gave the
garrison access to the water in case of siege, <a name="Page_208"></a>is obviously natural,
but had been improved by steps, now choked up. A girl who came with us
recollected she had shown me the way down to the bottom of this terrible
gulf seven years ago. I am not able for it now.</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>June</i> 29.&mdash;Being Sunday we kept about the doors, and after two took the
drosky and drove over the hill and round by the Kiery Craigs. I should
have said Williams came out in the morning to ask my advice about
staying another year in Edinburgh. I advised him if possible to gain a
few days' time till I should hear from Lockhart. He has made a pretty
mess for himself, but if the Bishops are wise, they may profit by it.
The sound, practical advice of Williams at the first concoction would be
of the last consequence. I suspect their systems of eating-houses are
the most objectionable part of the college discipline. When their
attentions are to be given to the departments of the cook and the
butler, all zeal in the nobler paths of education is apt to decay.</p>

<p>Well, to return to the woods. I think, notwithstanding Lord Chief
Commissioner's assiduity, they are in some places too thick. I saw a
fine larch, felled seventy-two years old, value about five pounds.</p>

<p>Hereditary descent in the Highlands. A clergyman showed J.T. the island
of Inch Mahome in the Port of Monteith, and pointed out the boatman as a
remarkable person, the representative of the hereditary gardeners of the
Earls of Monteith, while these Earls existed. His son, a priggish boy,
follows up the theme&mdash;&quot;Feyther, when Donald MacCorkindale dees will not
the family be extinct?&quot; Father&mdash;&quot;No; I believe there is a man in
Balquhidder who takes up the <i>succession</i>.&quot;</p>

<p><i>June</i> 30.&mdash;We made our pleasant excursion to-day round <a name="Page_209"></a>the hill of
Bennarty <i>par terre</i>, and returned <i>par mer</i>. Our route by land led us
past Lochore, where we made a pause for a few moments. Then proceeded to
Ballingray or Bingray, and so by Kirkness, where late ravages are
supplied by the force of vegetation down to the shores of Lochleven. We
embarked and went upon Saint Serf's Island, supposed to have been
anciently a cell of the Culdees. An old pinfold, or rather a modern
pinfold, constructed out of the ancient chapel, is all that attests its
former sanctity. We landed on Queen Mary's Island, a miserable scene,
considering the purpose for which the Castle was appointed. And yet the
captivity and surrender of the Percy was even a worse tale, since it was
an eternal blight on the name of Douglas. Well, we got to Blair Adam in
due time, and our fine company began to separate, Lord Chief Baron going
off after dinner. We had wine and wassail, and John Thomson's delightful
flute to help us through the evening.</p>

<p>Thus end the delectations of the Blair Adam Club for this year. Mrs.
Thomson of Charlton talks of Beaton's House, and other Fife wonders for
the next year, but who knows what one year may bring forth? Our Club has
been hitherto fortunate. It has subsisted twelve years.</p><a name="Page_210"></a>

</div></div>

<p><i>July</i> I, <i>[Edinburgh].</i>&mdash;Got home, however, by nine, and went to the
Parliament House, where we were detained till four o'clock. Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
dined with us, a professed lion-huntress, who travels the country to
rouse the peaceful beasts out of their lair, and insists on being hand
and glove with all the leonine race. She is very plain, besides
frightfully red-haired, and out-Lydia-ing even my poor friend Lydia
White. An awful visitation! I think I see her with javelin raised and
buskined foot, a second Diana, roaming the hills of Westmoreland in
quest of the lakers. Would to God she were there or anywhere but here!
Affectation is a painful thing to witness, and this poor woman has the
bad taste to think direct flattery is the way to make her advances to
friendship and intimacy.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 2.&mdash;I believe I was cross yesterday. I am at any rate very ill
to-day with a rheumatic headache, and a still more vile hypochondriacal
affection, which fills my head with pain, my heart with sadness, and my
eyes with tears. I do not wonder at the awful feelings which visited men
less educated and less firm than I may call myself. It is a most
hang-dog cast of feeling, but it may be chased away by study or by
exercise. The last I have always found most successful, but the first is
most convenient. I wrought therefore, <a name="Page_211"></a>and endured all this forenoon,
being a Teind Wednesday. I am now in such a state that I would hardly be
surprised at the worst news which could be brought to me. And all this
without any rational cause why to-day should be sadder than yesterday.</p>

<p>Two things to lighten my spirits&mdash;First, Cadell comes to assure me that
the stock of 12mo novels is diminished from 3800, which was the quantity
in the publishers' hands in March 1827, to 600 or 700. This argues
gallant room for the publication of the New Series. Second, said Cadell
is setting off straight for London to set affairs a-going. If I have
success in this, it will greatly assist in extricating my affairs.</p>

<p>My aches of the heart terminated in a cruel aching of the
head&mdash;rheumatic, I suppose. But Sir Adam and Clerk came to dinner, and
laughed and talked the sense of pain and oppression away. We cannot at
times work ourselves into a gay humour, any more than we can tickle
ourselves into a fit of laughter; foreign agency is necessary. My
huntress of lions again dined with us. I have subscribed to her Album,
and done what was civil.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 3.&mdash;Corrected proofs in the morning, and wrote a little. I was
forced to crop vol. i. as thirty pages too long; there is the less to
write behind. We were kept late at the Court, and when I came out I
bethought me, like Christian in the Castle of Giant Despair, &quot;Wherefore
should I walk along the broiling and stifling streets when I have a
little key in my bosom which can open any lock in Princes Street Walks,
and be thus on the Castle banks, rocks, and trees in a few minutes?&quot; I
made use of my key accordingly, and walked from the Castle Hill down to
Wallace's Tower,<a name="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> and thence to the west end of Princes Street,
through a scene of grandeur and beauty perhaps unequalled, whether the
foreground or distant view is considered&mdash;all down hill, too. Foolish
never to think of this before. I chatted with the girls a good while
after dinner, but wrote a trifle when we had tea.</p>
<a name="Page_212"></a>
<p><i>July</i> 4.&mdash;The two Annes set off to Abbotsford, though the weather was
somewhat lowering for an open carriage, but the day cleared up finely.
Hamilton is unwell, so we had a long hearing of his on our hands. It was
four ere I got home, but I had taken my newly discovered path by rock,
bush, and ruin. I question if Europe has such another path. We owe this
to the taste of James Skene. But I must dress to go to Dr. Hope's, who
makes <i>ch&egrave;re exquise</i>, and does not understand being kept late.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 5.&mdash;Saturday, corrected proofs and wrought hard. Went out to
dinner at Oxenfoord Castle, and returned in the company of Lord Alloway,
Chief Baron, Clerk, etc., and Mr. Bouverie, the English Commissioner.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 6.&mdash;A day of hard work. The second volume is now well
advanced&mdash;wellnigh one half. Dined alone, and pursued my course after
dinner. Seven pages were finished. Solitude's a fine thing for work, but
then you must lie by like a spider, till you collect materials to
continue your web. Began Simond's Switzerland&mdash;clever and intelligent,
but rather conceited, as the manner of an American Frenchman. I hope to
knock something out of him though.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 7.&mdash;Williams seems in uncertainty again, and I can't guess what
he will be at. Surely it is a misery to be so indecisive; he will
certainly gain the ill word of both parties and might have had the good
word of all; and, indeed, deserves it. We received his resignation
to-day, but if the King's College are disposed to thrive, they will keep
eyes on this very able man.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 8.&mdash;Hard work in the Court, the sederunts turn long and
burthensome. I fear they will require some abridgment of vacation.</p>

<br />

<p>Having omitted to carry on my Diary for two or three days, I lost heart
to make it up, and left it unfilled for many a month and day. During
this period nothing has happened worth particular notice. The same
occupations, the same amusements, the same occasional alternations of
spirits, gay or depressed, the same absence of all sensible or rational
cause for the one or the other. I half grieve to take up my pen, and
doubt if it is worth while to record such an infinite quantity of
nothing, but hang it! I hate to be beat, so here goes for better
behaviour.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 10.&mdash;I resume my task at Abbotsford. We are here alone, except
Lockhart, on a flying visit. Morritt, his niece, Sir James Stuart,
Skene, and an occasional friend or two, have been my guests since 31st
December. I cannot say I have been happy, for the feeling of increasing
weakness in my lame leg is a great affliction. I walk now with pain and
difficulty at all times, and it sinks my soul to think how soon I may be
altogether a disabled cripple. I am tedious to my friends, and I doubt
the sense of it makes me fretful.</p>

<p>Everything else goes off well enough. My cash affairs are clearing, and
though last year was an expensive one, I have been paying debt. Yet I
have a dull contest before me which will probably outlast my life. If
well maintained, however, it will be an honourable one, and if the
<i>Magnum Opus</i> succeed, it will afford me some repose.</p><a name="Page_216"></a>

<p><i>January</i> 11.&mdash;I did not write above a page yesterday; most weary,
stale, and unprofitable have been my labours. Received a letter I
suppose from Mad. T.&mdash;&mdash;, proposing a string of historical subjects not
proper for my purpose. People will not consider that a thing may already
be so well told in history, that romance ought not in prudence to meddle
with it.</p>

<p>The ground covered with snow, which, by slipperiness and the pain
occasioned by my lameness, renders walking unpleasant.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 12.&mdash;This is the third day I have not walked out, pain and
lameness being the cause. This bodes very ill for my future life. I made
a search yesterday and to-day for letters of Lord Byron to send to Tom
Moore, but I could only find two. I had several others, and am shocked
at missing them. The one which he sent me with a silver cup I regret
particularly. It was stolen out of the cup itself by some vile
inhospitable scoundrel, for a servant would not have thought such a
theft worth while.</p>

<p>My spirits are low, yet I wot not why. I have been writing to my sons.
Walter's majority was like to be reduced, but is spared for the present.
Charles is going on well I trust at the Foreign Office, so I hope all is
well.</p>

<p>Loitered out a useless day, half arranging half disarranging books and
papers, and packing the things I shall want. <i>Der Abschiedstag ist da</i>.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 13.&mdash;The day of return to Edinburgh is come. I don't know why,
but I am more happy at the change than usual. I am not working hard, and
it is what I ought to do, and must do. Every hour of laziness cries fie
upon me. But there is a perplexing sinking of the heart which one cannot
always overcome. At such times I have wished myself a clerk,
quill-driving for twopence per page. You have at least application, and
that is all that is necessary, whereas unless your lively faculties are
awake and pro<a name="Page_217"></a>pitious, your application will do you as little good as if
you strained your sinews to lift Arthur's Seat.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 14, [<i>Edinburgh</i>].&mdash;Got home last night after a freezing
journey. This morning I got back some of the last copy, and tugged as
hard as ever did soutar to make ends meet. Then I will be reconciled to
my task, which at present disgusts me. Visited Lady Jane, then called on
Mr. Robison and instructed him to call a meeting of the Council of the
Royal Society, as Mr. Knox proposes to read an essay on some
dissections. A bold proposal truly from one who has had so lately the
boldness of trading so deep in human flesh! I will oppose his reading in
the present circumstances if I should stand alone, but I hope he will be
wrought upon to withdraw his essay or postpone it at least. It is very
bad taste to push himself forward just now. Lockhart dined with us,
which made the evening a pleasant but an idle one. Well! I must rouse
myself.</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>January</i> 15.&mdash;Day began with beggars as usual, and John Nicolson has
not sense to keep them out. I never yield, however, to this importunity,
thinking it wrong that what I can spare to meritorious poverty, of which
I hear and see too much, should be diverted by impudent importunity. I
was detained at the Parliament House till nearly three by the great case
concerning prescription, Maule <i>v</i>. Maule.<a name="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> This was made up to me
by hearing an excellent opinion from Lord Corehouse, with a curious
discussion <i>in apicibus juris.</i> I disappointed Graham<a name="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> of a sitting
for my picture.</p>

<p><a name="Page_218"></a>I went to the Council of the Royal Society, which was convened at my
request, to consider whether we ought to hear a paper on anatomical
subjects read by Mr. Knox, whose name has of late been deeply implicated
in a criminal prosecution against certain wretches, who had murdered
many persons and sold their bodies to professors of the anatomical
science. Some thought that our declining to receive the paper would be a
declaration unfavourable to Dr. Knox. I think hearing it before Mr. Knox
has made any defence (as he is stated to have in view) would be an
intimation of our preference of the cause of science to those of
morality and common humanity. Mr. Knox's friends undertook to deal with
him about suffering the paper to be omitted for the present, while
<i>adhuc coram judice lis est</i>.<a name="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>January</i> 16.&mdash;Nothing on the roll to-day, so I did not go to the
Parliament House, but fagged at my desk till two.</p>

<p><a name="Page_219"></a>Dr. Ross called to relieve me of a corn, which, though my lameness
needs no addition, had tormented me vilely. I again met the Royal
Society Council. Dr. Knox consents to withdraw his paper, or rather
suffers the reading to be postponed. There is some great error in the
law on the subject. If it was left to itself many bodies would be
imported from France and Ireland, and doubtless many would be found in
our hospitals for the service of the anatomical science. But the total
and severe exclusion of foreign supplies of this kind raises the price
of the &quot;subjects,&quot; as they are called technically, to such a height,
that wretches are found willing to break into &quot;the bloody house of
life,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a> merely to supply the anatomists' table. The law which, as a
deeper sentence on the guilt of murder, declares that the body of the
convicted criminal should be given up to anatomy, is certainly not
without effect, for criminals have been known to shrink from that part
of the sentence which seems to affect them more than the doom of death
itself, with all its terrors here and hereafter. On the other hand,
while this idea of the infamy attending the exposition of the person is
thus recognised by the law, it is impossible to adopt regulations which
would effectually prevent such horrid crimes as the murder of vagrant
wretches who can be snatched from society without their being missed, as
in the case of the late conspiracy. For instance, if it was now to be
enacted, as seems reasonable, that persons dying in hospitals and
almshouses, who die without their friends claiming their remains, should
be given up to the men of science, this would be subjecting poverty to
the penalty of these atrocious criminals whom law distinguishes by the
heaviest posthumous disgrace which it can inflict. Even cultivated minds
revolt from the exposure on an anatomical table, when the case is
supposed to be that of one who is dear to them. I should, I am
conscious, be willing that I <a name="Page_220"></a>myself should be dissected in public, if
doing so could produce any advantage to society, but when I think on
relations and friends being rent from the grave the case is very
different, and I would fight knee-deep to prevent or punish such an
exposure. So inconsistent we are all upon matters of this nature.</p>

<p>I dined quietly at home with the girls, and wrote after dinner.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 17.&mdash;Nothing in the roll; corrected proofs, and went off at 12
o'clock in the Hamilton stage to William Lockhart's at Auchinrath. My
companions, Mr. Livingstone, the clergyman of Camnethan, a Bailie
Hamilton, the king of trumps, I am told, in the Burgh of Hamilton, and a
Mr. Davie Martin <i>qui gaudet equis et canibus</i>. Got to Auchinrath by
six, and met Lord Douglas,<a name="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> his brother, Captain Douglas, E.N., John
G-. Lockhart also, who had a large communication from Duke of W. upon
the subject of the bullion. The Duke scouts the economist's ideas about
paper credit, after the proposition that all men shall be entitled to
require gold.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 18.&mdash;We went, the two Lockharts and I, to William's new
purchase of Milton. We found on his ground a cottage, where a man called
Greenshields,<a name="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> a sensible, powerful-minded person, had at
twenty-eight (rather too late a week)<a name="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> taken up the art of
sculpture. He had disposed of the person of the King most admirably,
according to my poor thoughts, and had attained a wonderful expression
of ease and majesty at the same time. He was desirous of engaging on
Burns' Jolly Beggars, which I dissuaded. Caricature is not the object of
sculpture.</p>

<p>We went to Milton on as fine a day as could consist with snow on the
ground. The situation is eminently <a name="Page_221"></a>beautiful; a fine promontory round
which the Clyde makes a magnificent bend. We fixed on a situation where
the sitting-room should command the upper view, and, with an ornamental
garden, I think it may be made the prettiest place in Scotland.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 19.&mdash;Posted to Edinburgh with John Lockhart. We stopped at
Allanton to see a tree transplanted, which was performed with great
ease. Sir Henry is a sad coxcomb, and lifted beyond the solid earth by
the effect of his book's success. But the book well deserves it.<a name="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> He
is in practice particularly anxious to keep the roots of the tree near
the surface, and only covers them with about a foot of earth.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;Lime rubbish dug in among the roots of ivy encourages it much.</p>

<p>The operation delayed us three hours, so it was seven o'clock before we
reached our dinner and a good fire in Shandwick Place, and we were
wellnigh frozen to death. During this excursion I walked very ill&mdash;with
more pain, in fact, than I ever remember to have felt&mdash;and, even leaning
on John Lockhart, could hardly get on. <i>Baad that, vara baad</i>&mdash;it might
be the severe weather though, and the numbing effect of the sitting in
the carriage. Be it what it will, I can't help myself.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 20.&mdash;I had little to do at the Court, and returned home soon.
Honest old Mr. Ferrier is dead, at extreme old age. I confess I should
not wish to live so long. He was a man with strong passions and strong
prejudices, but with generous and manly sentiments at the same time. We
used to call him Uncle Adam, after that character in his gifted
daughter's novel of the <i>Heiress</i> [Inheritance]. I wrote a long letter
after I came home to my Lord Elgin about Greenshields, the
sculptor.<a name="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> I am afraid <a name="Page_222"></a>he is going into the burlesque line, to
which sculpture is peculiarly ill adapted. So I have expressed my veto
to his patron, <i>valeat quantum</i>. Also a letter to Mrs. Professor
Sandford at Glasgow about reprinting Macaulay's <i>History of St.
Kilda</i>,<a name="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> advising them to insert the history of Lady Grange who was
kidnapped and banished thither.</p>

<p>I corrected my proofs, moreover, and prepared to dine. After dinner we
go to Euphemia Erskine's marriage. Mr. Dallas came in and presented me
with an old pedigree of the M'Intoshes. The wedding took place with the
usual April weather of smiles and tears. The bridegroom's name is
Dawson. As he, as well as the bride, is very tall, they have every
chance of bringing up a family of giants. The bridegroom has an
excellent character. He is only a captain, but economy does wonders in
the army, where there are many facilities for practising it. I sincerely
wish them happiness.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 21.&mdash;Went out to Dalkeith House to dine and stay all night.
Found Marquis of Lothian and a family party. I liked the sense and
spirit displayed by this young nobleman, who reminds me strongly of his
parents, whom I valued so highly.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 22.&mdash;Left Dalkeith after breakfast, and gained the Parliament
House, where there was almost nothing to do, at eleven o'clock.
Afterwards sat to Graham, who is making a good thing of it. Mr. Colvin
Smith has made a better in one sense, having sold ten or twelve copies
of the portrait to different friends.<a name="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a> The Solicitor came to dine
with me&mdash;we drank a bottle of champagne, and two bottles of claret,
which, in former days, I should have thought a very sober allowance,
since, Lockhart included, there were three persons to drink it. But I
felt I had drunk too much, and was uncomfortable. The young men stood it
<a name="Page_223"></a>like young men. Skene and his wife and daughter looked in in the
evening. I suppose I am turning to my second childhood, for not only am
I filled drunk, or made stupid at least, with one bottle of wine, but I
am disabled from writing by chilblains on my fingers&mdash;a most babyish
complaint. They say that the character is indicated by the handwriting;
if so, mine is crabbed enough.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 23.&mdash;Still severe frost, annoying to sore fingers. Nothing on
the roll. I sat at home and wrote letters to Wilkie, Landseer, Mrs.
Hughes, Charles, etc. Went out to old Mr. Ferrier's funeral, and saw the
last duty rendered to my old friend, whose age was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;Like a lusty winter,<br /></span>
<span>Frosty, but kindly,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I mean in a moral as well as a physical sense. I then went to Cadell's
for some few minutes.</p>

<p>I carried out Lockhart to Dalkeith, where we dined, supped, and returned
through a clinking frost, with snow on the ground. Lord Ramsay and the
Miss Kerrs were at Dalkeith. The Duke shows, for so young a man, a great
deal of character, and seems to have a proper feeling of the part he has
to play. The evening was pleasant, but the thought that I was now the
visitor and friend of the family in the third generation lay somewhat
heavy on me. Every thing around me seemed to say that beauty, power,
wealth, honour were but things of a day.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 24.&mdash;Heavy fall of snow. Lockhart is off in the mail. I hope
he will not be blockaded. The day bitter cold. I went to the Court, and
with great difficulty returned along the slippery street. I ought to
have taken the carriage, but I have a superstitious dread of giving up
the habit of walking, and would willingly stick to the last by my old
hardy customs.</p>
<a name="Page_224"></a>
<p>Little but trifles to do at the Court. My hands are so covered with
chilblains that I can hardly use a pen&mdash;my feet ditto.</p>

<p>We bowled away at six o'clock to Mr. Wardlaw Ramsay's. Found we were a
week too early, and went back as if our noses had been bleeding.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 25.&mdash;Worked seriously all morning, expecting the Fergusons to
dinner. Alas! instead of that, I learn that my poor innocent friend Mary
is no more. She was a person of some odd and peculiar habits, wore a
singular dress, and affected wild and solitary haunts, but she was, at
the same time, a woman of talent, and even genius. She used often to
take long walks with me up through the glens; and I believe her sincere
good wishes attended me, as I was always glad of an opportunity to show
her kindness. I shall long think of her when at Abbotsford. This sad
event breaks up our little party. Will Clerk came, however, and his
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> was, of course, interesting and amusing in the highest
degree. We drank some whisky and water, and smoked a cigar or two, till
nine at night.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;No after friendships ere can raise<br /></span>
<span>The endearments of our early days.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>January</i> 26.&mdash;I muzzed on&mdash;I can call it little better&mdash;with <i>Anne of
Geierstein</i>. The materials are excellent, but the power of using them is
failing. Yet I wrote out about three pages, sleeping at intervals.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 27.&mdash;A great and general thaw, the streets afloat, the snow
descending on one's head from the roofs. Went to the Court. There was
little to do. Left about twelve, and took a sitting with Graham, who
begs for another. Sir James Stuart stood bottle-holder on this occasion.
Had rather an unfavourable account of the pictures of James Stuart of
Dunearn, which are to be sold. I had promised to pick up one or two for
the Duke of Buccleuch.<a name="Page_225"></a> Came home and wrote a leaf or two. I shall be
soon done with the second volume of <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>. I cannot
persuade myself to the obvious risk of satisfying the public, although I
cannot so well satisfy myself. I am like Beaumont and Fletcher's old
Merrythought who could not be persuaded that there was a chance of his
wanting meat. I never came into my parlour, said he, but I found the
cloth laid and dinner ready; surely it will be always thus. Use makes
perfectness.<a name="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p>My reflections are of the same kind; and if they are unlogical they are
perhaps not the less comfortable. Fretting and struggling does no good.
Wrote to Miss Margaret Ferguson a letter of condolence.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 28.&mdash;Breakfasted, for a wonder, abroad with Hay Drummond,
whose wife appears a pretty and agreeable little woman. We worshipped
his tutelar deity, the Hercules, and saw a good model of the Hercules
Bibax, or the drunken Hercules. Graham and Sir James Stuart were there.
Home-baked bread and soldier's coffee were the treat. I came home; and
Sir Robert Dundas having taken my duty at the Court, I wrote for some
time, but not much. Burke the murderer hanged this morning. The mob,
which was immense, demanded Knox and Hare, but though greedy for more
victims, received with shouts the solitary wretch who found his way to
the gallows out of five or six who seem not less guilty than he. But the
story begins to be stale, although I believe a doggerel ballad upon it
would be popular, how brutal soever the wit. This is the progress of
human passions. We ejaculate, exclaim, hold up to Heaven our hand, like
the rustic Phidyle<a name="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a>&mdash;next morning the mood changes, and we dance a
jig to the tune which moved us to tears. Mr. Bell sends me a specimen of
a historical novel, <a name="Page_226"></a>but he goes not the way to write it; he is too
general, and not sufficiently minute. It is not easy to convey this to
an author, with the necessary attention to his feelings; and yet, in
good faith and sincerity, it must be done.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 29.&mdash;I had a vacant day once more by the kindness of Sir
Robert, unasked, but most kindly afforded. I have not employed it to
much purpose. I wrote six pages to Croker,<a name="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> who is busied with a new
edition of Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>, to which most entertaining book
he hopes to make large additions from Mrs. Piozzi, Hawkins and other
sources. I am bound by many obligations to do as much for him as I can,
which can only respect the Scottish Tour. I wrote only two or three
pages of <i>Anne</i>. I am</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;- as one who in a darksome way<br /></span>
<span>Doth walk with fear and dread.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But walk I must, and walk forward too, or I shall be benighted with a
vengeance. After dinner, to compromise matters with my conscience, I
wrote letters to Mr. Bell, Mrs. Hughes, and so forth; thus I concluded
the day with a sort of busy idleness. This will not do. By cock and pye
it will not.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 30.&mdash;Mr. Stuart breakfasted with me, a grand-nephew of Lady
Louisa's, a very pleasing young gentleman. The coach surprised me by not
calling. <i>Will</i> it be for the Martyrdom? I trow it will, yet, strange to
say, I cannot recollect if it is a regular holiday or not.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Uprouse ye then, my merry, merry men,<br /></span>
<span>And use it as ye may.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I wrote in the morning, and went at one o'clock to a meeting of country
gentlemen, about bringing the direct road from London down by Jedburgh,
said to be the nearest line by fifty miles. It is proposed the pleasant
men of Teviotdale <a name="Page_227"></a>should pay, not only their own share,&mdash;that is, the
expense of making the road through our own country, but also the expense
of making the road under the Ellsdon Trust in Northumberland, where the
English would positively do nothing. I stated this to the meeting as an
act of Quixotry. If it be an advantage, which, unless to individuals,
may be doubted, it is equally one to Northumberland as to Roxburgh,
therefore I am clear that we should go &quot;acquals.&quot;</p>

<p>I think I have maybe put a spoke in the wheel. The raising the statute
labour of Roxburgh to an oppressive extent, to make roads in England,
is, I think, jimp legal, and will be much complained of by the poorer
heritors. Henry of Harden dines with me <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, excepting the
girls.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 31.&mdash;I thought I had opened a vein this morning and that it
came freely, but the demands of art have been more than I can bear. I
corrected proofs before breakfast, went to Court after that meal; was
busy till near one o'clock. Then I went to Cadell's, where they are
preparing to circulate the prospectus of the magnum, which will have all
the effect of surprise on most people. I sat to Mr. Graham till I was
quite tired, then went to Lady Jane, who is getting better. Then here at
four, but fit for nothing but to bring up this silly Diary.</p>

<p>The corpse of the murderer Burke is now lying in state at the College,
in the anatomical class, and all the world flock to see him. Who is he
that says that we are not ill to please in our objects of curiosity? The
strange means by which the wretch made money are scarce more disgusting
than the eager curiosity with which the public have licked up all the
carrion details of this business.</p>

<p>I trifled with my work. I wonder how Johnson set himself doggedly to
it&mdash;to a work of imagination it seems quite impossible, and one's brain
is at times fairly addled. And yet I have felt times when sudden and
strong exertion <a name="Page_228"></a>would throw off all this mistiness of mind, as a north
wind would disperse it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Blow, blow, thou northern wind.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nothing more than about two or three pages. I went to the Parliament
House to-day, but had little to do. I sat to Mr. Graham the last time,
Heaven be praised! If I be not known in another age, it will not be for
want of pictures. We dined with Mr. Wardlaw Ramsay and Lady Anne&mdash;a fine
family. There was little done in the way of work except correcting
proofs. The bile affects me, and makes me vilely drowsy when I should be
most awake. Met at Mr. Wardlaw's several people I did not know. Looked
over Cumnor Hall by Mr. Usher Tighe of Oxford. I see from the
inscription on Tony Foster's tomb that he was a skilful planter, amongst
other fashionable accomplishments.</p>

<a name="FEBRUARY_1829"></a><h2>FEBRUARY.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>February</i> 1.&mdash;<i>Domum mansi, lanam feci</i>,&mdash;stayed at home <i>videlicet</i>,
and laboured without interruption except from intolerable drowsiness;
finished eight leaves, however, the best day's work I have made this
long time. No interruption, and I got pleased with my work, which ends
the second volume of <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>. After dinner had a letter
from Lockhart, with happy tidings about the probability of the
commission on the Stewart papers being dissolved. The Duke of W. says
commissions never either did or will do any good. John will in that case
be sole editor of these papers with an apartment at St. James's <i>cum
plurimis aliis</i>. It will be a grand coup if it takes place.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 2.&mdash;Sent off yesterday's work with proofs. Could I do as
toughly for a week&mdash;and many a day I have done more&mdash;I should be soon
out of the scrape. I wrote letters, and put over the day till one, when
I went down with Sir James Stuart to see Stuart of Dunearn's pictures
now on sale. I did not see much which my poor taste covets; a Hobbema
much admired is, I think, as tame a piece of work as I ever saw. I
promised to try to get a good picture or two for the young Duke.</p>

<p>Dined with the old Club, instituted forty years ago. There were present
Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Advocate, Sir Peter Murray, John Irving,
William Clerk, and I. It was a party such as the meeting of fellow
scholars and fellow students alone could occasion. We told old stories;
laughed and quaffed, and resolved, rashly perhaps, that we would hold
the Club at least once a year, if possible twice. We will see how this
will fudge. Our mirth was more un<a name="Page_230"></a>expected as Sir Adam, our first
fiddle, was wanting, owing to his family loss.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 3.&mdash;Rose at eight&mdash;felt my revel a little in my head. The
Court business light, returned by Cadell, and made one or two calls, at
Skene's especially. Dinner and evening at home; laboriously employed.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 4.&mdash;To-day I was free from duty, and made good use of my
leisure at home, finishing the second volume of <i>Anne</i>, and writing
several letters, one to recommend Captain Pringle to Lord Beresford,
which I send to-morrow through Morritt. &quot;My mother whips me and I whip
the top.&quot; The girls went to the play.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 5.&mdash;Attended the Court as usual, got dismissed about one.
Finished and sent off volume ii. of <i>Anne</i>. Dined with Robert
Rutherford, my cousin, and the whole clan of Swinton.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 6.&mdash;Corrected proofs in the morning, then to the Court;
thence to Cadell's, where I found some business cut out for me, in the
way of notes, which delayed me. Walked home, the weary way giving my
feet the ancient twinges of agony: such a journey is as severe a penance
as if I had walked the same length with peas in my shoes to atone for
some horrible crime by beating my toes into a jelly. I wrote some and
corrected a good deal. We dined alone, and I partly wrought partly slept
in the evening. It's now pretty clear that the Duke of W. intends to
have a Catholic Bill.<a name="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> He probably expects to neutralise and divide
the Catholic body by bringing a few into Parliament, where they will
probably be tractable enough, rather than a <a name="Page_231"></a>large proportion of them
rioting in Ireland, where they will be to a certain degree unanimous.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 7.&mdash;Up and wrought a little. I had at breakfast a son of Sir
Thomas Dick Lauder, a very quick, smart-looking young fellow, who is on
his way to the Continent with a tutor. Dined at Mrs. George Swinton's
with the whole clan.</p><a name="Page_232"></a>

<p><i>February</i> 8.&mdash;I wrought the whole day and finished about six pages of
manuscript of vol. iii. [<i>Anne of Geierstein</i>]. <i>Sat cito si sat bene</i>.
The Skenes came in to supper like the olden world.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 9.&mdash;Was up in good time (say half-past seven), and employed
the morning in correcting proofs. At twelve I went to Stuart of
Dunearn's sale of pictures. This poor man fell, like myself, a victim to
speculation. And though I had no knowledge of him personally, and
disliked him as the cause of poor Sir Alexander Boswell's death, yet
&quot;had he been slaughterman to all my kin,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> I could but pity the
miserable sight of his splendid establishment broken up, and his
treasures of art exposed to public and unsparing sale. I wanted a
picture of the Earl of Rothes for the Duke of Buccleuch, a fine Sir
Joshua, but Balfour of Balbirnie fancied it also, and followed it to 160
guineas. Charles Sharpe's account is, that I may think myself in luck,
for the face has been repainted. There is, he says, a print taken from
the picture at Leslie House which has quite a different countenance from
the present.</p>

<p>This job, however, took me up the whole morning to little purpose.
Captain and Mrs. Hall dined with us, also Sir James Stuart, Charles
Sharpe, John Scott of Gala, etc.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 10.&mdash;I was up at seven this morning, and will continue the
practice, but the shoal of proofs took up all my leisure. I will not, I
think, go after these second-rate pictures again to-day. If I could get
a quiet day or two I would make a deep dint in the third volume; but
hashed and smashed as my time is, who can make anything of it? I read
over Henry's History of Henry VI. and Edward IV.; he is but a stupid
historian after all. This took me up the whole day.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 11.&mdash;Up as usual and wrought at proofs. Mr. Hay Drummond and
Macintosh Mackay dined. The last <a name="Page_233"></a>brought me his history of the <i>Blara
Leine</i> or White Battle (battle of the shirts). To the Court, and
remained there till two, when we had some awkward business in the
Council of the Royal Society.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 12.&mdash;W. Lockhart came to breakfast, full of plans for his
house, which will make a pretty and romantic habitation. After breakfast
the Court claimed its vassal.</p>

<p>As I came out Mr. Chambers introduced a pretty little romantic girl to
me who possessed a laudable zeal to know a live poet. I went with my
fair admirer as far as the new rooms on the Mound, where I looked into
the Royal Society's Rooms, then into the Exhibition, in mere
unwillingness to work and desire to dawdle away time. Learned that Lord
Haddington had bought the Sir Joshua. I wrought hard to-day and made out
five pages.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 13.&mdash;This morning Col. Hunter Blair breakfasted here with his
wife, a very pretty woman, with a good deal of pleasant conversation.
She had been in India, and had looked about her to purpose. I wrote for
several hours in the forenoon, but was nervous and drumlie; also I
bothered myself about geography; in short, there was trouble, as miners
say when the vein of metal is interrupted. Went out at two, and walked,
thank God, better than in the winter, which gives me hopes that the
failure of the unfortunate limb is only temporary, owing to severe
weather. We dined at John Murray's with the Mansfield family. Lady
Caroline Murray possesses, I think, the most pleasing taste for music,
and is the best singer I ever heard. No temptation to display a very
brilliant voice ever leads her aside from truth and simplicity, and
besides, she looks beautiful when she sings.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 14.&mdash;Wrote in the morning, which begins to be a regular act
of duty. It was late ere I got home, and I did not do much. The letters
I received were numerous and craved answers, yet the third volume is
getting on hooly and <a name="Page_234"></a>fairly. I am twenty leaves before the printers;
but Ballantyne's wife is ill, and it is his nature to indulge
apprehensions of the worst, which incapacitates him for labour. I cannot
help regarding this amiable weakness of the mind with something too
nearly allied to contempt. I keep the press behind me at a good
distance, and I, like the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Postboy's horse, am glad to miss<br /></span>
<span>The lumber of the wheels.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>February</i> 15.&mdash;I wrought to-day, but not much&mdash;rather dawdled, and took
to reading Chambers's Beauties of Scotland,<a name="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a> which would be
admirable if they were more accurate. He is a clever young fellow, but
hurts himself by too much haste. I am not making too much myself I know,
and I know, too, it is time I were making it. Unhappily there is such a
thing as more haste and less speed. I can very seldom think to purpose
by lying perfectly idle, but when I take an idle book, or a walk, my
mind strays back to its task out of contradiction as it were; the things
I read become mingled with those I have been writing, and something is
concocted. I cannot compare this process of the mind to anything save
that of a woman to whom the mechanical operation of spinning serves as a
running bass to the songs she sings, or the course of ideas she pursues.
The phrase <i>Hoc age</i>, often quoted by my father, does not jump with my
humour. I cannot nail my mind to one subject of contemplation, and it is
by nourishing two trains of ideas that I can bring one into order.</p>

<p>Colin Mackenzie came in to see me, poor fellow. He looks well in his
retirement. Partly I envy him&mdash;partly I am better pleased as it is.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 16.&mdash;Stayed at home and laboured all the forenoon. Young
Invernahyle called to bid me interest myself about getting a lad of the
house of Scott a commission&mdash;how <a name="Page_235"></a>is this possible? The last I tried
for, there was about 3000 on the list&mdash;and they say the boy is too old,
being twenty-four. I scribbled three or four pages, forbore smoking and
whisky and water, and went to the Royal Society. There Sir William
Hamilton read an essay, the result of some anatomical investigations,
which contained a masked battery against the phrenologists.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 17.&mdash;In the morning I sent off copy and proof. I received the
melancholy news that James Ballantyne has lost his wife. With his
domestic habits the blow is irretrievable. What can he do, poor fellow,
at the head of such a family of children! I should not be surprised if
he were to give way to despair.</p>

<p>I was at the Court, where there was little to do, but it diddled away my
time till two. I went to the library, but not a book could I get to look
at. It is, I think, a wrong system the lending books to private houses
at all, and leads to immense annual losses. I called on Skene, and
borrowed a volume of his Journal, to get some information about Burgundy
and Provence. Something may be made out of King Ren&eacute;, but I wish I had
thought of him sooner.<a name="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> Dined alone with the girls.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 18.&mdash;This being Teind Wednesday I had a holiday. Worked the
whole day, interrupted by calls from <a name="Page_236"></a>Dr. Ross, Sir Hugh Palliser, Sir
David Hunter Blair, and Colonel Blair. I made out about six pages before
dinner, and go to Lord Gillies's to dine with a good conscience. Hay
Drummond came in, and discharged a volley at me which Mons Meg could
hardly have equalled. I will go to work with Skene's Journal. My head
aches violently, and has done so several days. It is cold, I think.</p>

<p>At Lord Gillies's we found Sir John Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple, and Miss
Ferguson, Mr. Hope Vere of Craigiehall, and Lady Elizabeth, a sister of
Lord Tweeddale, Sir Robert O'Callaghan, Captain Cathcart, and others&mdash;a
gay party.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 19.&mdash;An execrable day&mdash;half frost, half fresh, half sleet,
half rain, and wholly abominable. Having made up my packet for the
printing-house, and performed my duty at the Court, I had the firmness
to walk round by the North Bridge, and face the weather for two miles,
by way of exercise. Called on Skene, and saw some of his drawings of
Aix. It was near two before I got home, and now I hear three strike;
part of this hour has been consumed in a sound sleep by the fireside
after putting on dry things. I met Baron Hume,<a name="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> and we praised each
other's hardihood for daring to take exercise in such weather, agreeing
that if a man relax the custom of his exercise in Scotland for a bad
<a name="Page_237"></a>day he is not likely to resume it in a hurry. The other moiety of the
time was employed in looking over the <i>M&eacute;moires de Fauche-Borel.</i><a name="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>February</i> 20.&mdash;The Court duly took me up from eleven till about three,
but left some time for labour, which I employed to purpose, at least I
hope so. I declined going to the exhibition of paintings to-night;
neither the beauties of art nor of nature have their former charms for
me. I finished, however, about seven pages of manuscript, which is a
fair half of volume III. I wish I could command a little more time and I
would soon find you something or other, but the plague is that time is
wanting when I feel an aptitude to work, and when time abounds, the
will, at least the real efficient power of the faculties, is awanting.
Still, however, we make way by degrees. I glanced over some metrical
romances published by Hartshorne, several of which have not seen the
light. They are considerably curious, but I was surprised to see them
mingled with <i>Blanchefleur</i> and <i>Flor&ecirc;s</i> and one or two others which
might have been spared. There is no great display of notes or
prolegomena, and there is, moreover, no glossary. But the work is well
edited.<a name="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>February</i> 21.&mdash;Colonel Ferguson breakfasted with us. I was detained at
the Parliament House till the hour of poor Mrs. Ballantyne's funeral,
then attended that melancholy ceremony. The husband was unable to
appear; the sight of the poor children was piteous enough. James
Ballantyne has taken his brother Sandy into the house, I mean the firm,
about which there had formerly been some misunderstanding.</p>

<p>I attended the Bannatyne Club. We made a very good election, bringing in
Lord Dalhousie and the Lord Clerk Register.<a name="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> Our dinner went pretty
well off, but I have seen <a name="Page_238"></a>it merrier. To be sure old Dr. J., like an
immense featherbed, was <i>burking</i> me, as the phrase now goes, during the
whole time. I am sure that word will stick in the language for one
while.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 22.&mdash;Very rheumatic. I e'en turned my table to the fire and
feagued it away, as Bayes says. Neither did I so much as cast my eyes
round to see what sort of a day it was&mdash;the splashing on the windows
gave all information that was necessary. Yet, with all my leisure,
during the whole day I finished only four leaves of copy&mdash;somewhat of
the least, master Matthew.<a name="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>

<p>There was no interruption during the whole day, though the above is a
poor account of it.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 23.&mdash;Up and at it. After breakfast Mr. Hay Drummond came in
enchanted about Mons Meg,<a name="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> and roaring as loud as she could have
done for her life when she was in perfect voice.</p>

<p>James Ballantyne came in, to my surprise, about twelve o'clock. He was
very serious, and spoke as if he had some idea of sudden and speedy
death. He mentioned that he had named Cadell, Cowan, young Hughes, and
his brother to be his trustees with myself. He has settled to go to the
country, poor fellow, to Timpendean, as I think.</p>

<p>We dined at Skene's, where we met Mr. and Mrs. George Forbes, Colonel
and Mrs. Blair, George Bell, etc. The party was a pleasant one. Colonel
Blair said, that during the Battle of Waterloo there was at the
commencement some trouble necessary to prevent the men from breaking
their ranks. He expostulated with one man: &quot;Why, my good fellow, you
cannot propose to beat the French alone?&mdash;better keep your ranks.&quot; The
man, who was one of the 71st, returned to his ranks, saying, &quot;I believe
you are very right, <a name="Page_239"></a>sir, but I am a man of very <i>hot temper</i>.&quot; There
was much <i>bonhomie</i> in the reply.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 24.&mdash;Snowy miserable morning. I corrected my proofs, but had
no time to write anything. We, <i>i.e.</i> myself and the two Annes, went to
breakfast with Mr. Drummond Hay, where we again met Colonel and Mrs.
Blair, with Thomas Thomson. We looked over some most beautiful
drawings<a name="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> which Mrs. Blair had made in different parts of India,
exhibiting a species of architecture so gorgeous, and on a scale so
extensive, as to put to shame the magnificence of Europe. And yet, in
most cases, as little is known of the people who wrought these wonders
as of the kings who built the Pyramids. Fame depends on literature, not
on architecture. We are more eager to see a broken column of Cicero's
villa, than all those mighty labours of barbaric power. Mrs. Blair is
full of enthusiasm. She told me that when she worked with her pencil she
was glad to have some one to read to her as a sort of sedative,
otherwise her excitement made her tremble, and burst out a-crying. I can
understand this very well, having often found the necessity of doing two
things at once. She is a very pretty, dark woman too, and has been
compared to Rebecca, daughter of the Jew, Isaac of York.</p>

<p>Detained in the Court till half-past two bothering about Lady Essex
Kerr's will without coming to a conclusion. I then got home too late to
do anything, as I must prepare to go to Dalmahoy. Mr. Gibson came in for
a little while; no news.</p>

<p>I went to Dalmahoy, where we were most kindly received. It is a point of
friendship, however, to go eight miles to dinner and return in the
evening; and my day has been cut up without a brush of work. Smoked a
cigar on my return, being very cold.</p>

<p><a name="Page_240"></a><i>February</i> 25.&mdash;This morning I corrected my proofs. We get on, as John
Ferguson said when they put him on a hunter. I fear there is too much
historical detail, and the catastrophe will be vilely huddled up. &quot;And
who can help it, Dick?&quot; Visited James Ballantyne, and found him bearing
his distress sensibly and like a man. I called in at Cadell's, and also
inquired after Lady Jane Stuart, who is complaining. Three o'clock
placed me at home, and from that hour till ten, deduct two hours for
dinner, I was feaguing it away.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 26.&mdash;Sent off ten pages this morning, with a revise; we spy
land, but how to get my catastrophe packed into the compass allotted for
it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;It sticks like a pistol half out of its holster,<br /></span>
<span>Or rather indeed like an obstinate bolster,<br /></span>
<span>Which I think I have seen you attempting, my dear,<br /></span>
<span>In vain to cram into a small pillowbeer.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is no help for it&mdash;I must make a <i>tour de force</i>, and annihilate
both time and space. Dined at home; nevertheless made small progress.
But I must prepare my dough before I can light my oven. I would fain
think I am in the right road.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 27.&mdash;The last post brought a letter from Mr. Heath, proposing
to set off his engravings for the <i>Magnum Opus</i> against my contributions
for the <i>Keepsake</i>. A pretty mode of accounting that would be; he
be&mdash;&mdash;. I wrote him declining his proposal; and, as he says I am still
in his debt, I will send him the old drama of the <i>House of Aspen</i>,
which I wrote some thirty years ago, and offered to the stage. This will
make up my contribution, and a good deal more, if, as I recollect, there
are five acts. Besides, it will save me further trouble about Heath and
his Annual. Secondly, There are several manuscript copies of the play
abroad, and some of them will be popping out one of these days in a
contraband manner. Thirdly, If I am right as to the length <a name="Page_241"></a>of the
piece, there is &pound;100 extra work at least which will not be inconvenient
at all.</p>

<p>Dined at Sir John Hay's with Ramsay of Barnton and his young bride, Sir
David and Lady Hunter Blair, etc.</p>

<p>I should mention that Cadell breakfasted with me, and entirely approved
of my rejecting Heath's letter. There was one funny part of it, in which
he assured me that the success of the new edition of the <i>Waverley
Novels</i> depended entirely on the excellence of the illustrations&mdash;<i>vous
&ecirc;tes joaillier, Mons. Josse.<a name="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a></i> He touches a point which alarms me;
he greatly undervalues the portrait which Wilkie has prepared to give me
for this edition. If it is as little of a likeness as he says, it is a
scrape. But a scrape be it. Wilkie behaved in the kindest way,
considering his very bad health, in agreeing to work for me at all, and
I will treat him with due delicacy, and not wound his feelings by
rejecting what he has given in such kindness.<a name="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a> And so farewell to
Mr. Heath, and the conceited vulgar Cockney his Editor.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 28.&mdash;Finished my proofs this morning, and read part of a
curious work, called <i>Memoirs of Vidocq</i>; a fellow who was at the head
of Bonaparte's police. It is a pickaresque tale; in other words, a
romance of roguery. The whole seems much exaggerated, and got up; but I
suppose there is truth <i>au fond.</i> I came home about two o'clock, and
wrought hard and fast till night.</p>






<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="MARCH_1829"></a><h2><a name="Page_242"></a>MARCH</h2>
<br />

<p><i>March</i> 1.&mdash;I laboured hard the whole day, and, between hands, refreshed
myself with Vidocq's <i>Memoirs</i>. No one called except Hay Drummond, who
had something to say about Mons Meg. So I wrote before and after dinner,
till no less than ten pages were finished.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 2.&mdash;I wrought but little to-day. I was not in the vein, and felt
sleepy. I thought to go out, but disgust of the pavement kept me at
home, <i>O rus</i>, etc. It is pleasant to think that the 11th March sets us
on the route for Abbotsford. I shall be done long before with this
confounded novel. I wish I were, for I find trouble in bringing it to a
conclusion. People compliment me sometimes on the extent of my labour;
but if I could employ to purpose the hours that indolence and lassitude
steal away from me, they would have cause to wonder indeed. But day must
have night, vigilance must have sleep, and labour, bodily or mental,
must have rest. As Edgar says, I cannot fool it further.<a name="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> Anne is
gone to Hopetoun House for two days.</p>

<p>Dined at the Royal Society Club, and went to the Society in the evening.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 3.&mdash;Began this day with labour as usual, and made up my packet.
Then to the Court, where there is a deal of business. Hamilton, having
now a serious fit of the gout, is not expected to aid any more this
season. I wrote a little both before and after dinner. Niece Anne and I
dined alone. Three poets called, each bawling louder than <a name="Page_243"></a>the
other&mdash;subscribe, subscribe! I generally do, if the work be under 10s.;
but the wares were every one so much worse than another, that I declined
in the three instances before me. I got cross at the repeated demands,
and could have used Richard's apology&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Thou troubl'st me: I am not in the vein.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>March</i> 4.&mdash;Being Teind Wednesday, I settled myself at my desk and
laboured the whole forenoon. Got on to page seventy-two, so there cannot
be more than twenty pages wanted. Mr. Drummond Hay, who has an alertness
in making business out of nothing, came to call once more about Mons
Meg. He is a good-humoured gentlemanlike man, but I would Meg were in
his belly or he in hers. William Laidlaw also called, whom I asked to
dinner. At four o'clock arrives Mr. Cadell, with his horn charged with
good news. The prospectus of the <i>Magnum</i>, already issued only a week,
has produced such a demand among the trade, that he thinks he must add a
large number of copies, that the present edition of 7000 may be
increased to the demand; he talks of raising it to 10,000 or 12,000. If
so, I shall have a constant income to bear on my unfortunate debts to a
large amount yearly, and may fairly hope to put them in a secure way of
payment, even if I should be cut off in life, or in health, and the
power of labour. I hope to be able, in a year or two, to make proposals
for eating with my own spoons, and using my own books, which, if I can
give value for them, can hardly, I think, be refused to me.<a name="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> In the
meantime I have enough, and something to bequeath to my poor children.
This is a great mercy, but I must prepare for disappointment, and I will
not be elated.</p>

<p>Laidlaw dined with me, and, poor fellow, was as much elated with the
news as I am, for it is not of a nature to be kept secret. I hope I
shall have him once more at <a name="Page_244"></a>Kaeside to debate, as we used to do, on
religion and politics. Meanwhile, patience, cousin, and shuffle the
cards.</p>

<p>I must do what I can to get Cadell's discharge from his creditors; this
I have always done, and so far effectually, but it would be most
inconvenient to be at the mercy of creditors who may at any moment make
inquiry into his affairs and so stop his operations. The Old Bank of
Scotland are the only parties whose consent has not been obtained to his
discharge, and they must see their interest in consenting to it for the
expediting of my affairs; since to what purpose oppose it, for they have
not the least chance of mending their own by refusing it.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 5.&mdash;Proofs arranged in the morning. Sir Patrick Walker, that
Solomon the second, came to propose to me that some benefit society,
which he patronises, should attend upon Mons Meg; but, with the Celts at
my disposal, I have every reason to think they would be affronted at
being marched along with Sir Peter and his tail of trades' lads. I went
to the Court, which detained me till two, then to poor old Lady
Seaforth's funeral,<a name="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a> which was numerously attended. It was near four
ere I got home, bringing Skene with me. We called at Cadell's; the
edition of the <i>Magnum</i> is raised from 7000 to 10,000. There will really
be a clearance in a year or two if R.C. is not too sanguine. I never saw
so much reason for indulging hope. By the bye, I am admitted a member of
the Maitland Club, a Society on the principle of the Roxburghe and
Bannatyne. What a tail of the alphabet I should draw after me were I to
sign with the indications of the different societies I belong to,
beginning with President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and ended
with umpire of the Six-foot-high Club!<a name="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> Dined at home, and in quiet,
with the girls.</p>

<p><a name="Page_245"></a><i>March</i> 6.&mdash;Made some considerable additions to the Appendix to General
Preface. I am in the sentiments towards the public that the buffoon
player expresses towards his patron&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Go tell my young lord, said this modest young man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If he will but invite me to dinner,<br /></span>
<span>I'll be as diverting as ever I can&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will, on the faith of a sinner.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I will multiply the notes, therefore, when there is a chance of giving
pleasure and variety. There is a stronger gleam of hope on my affairs
than has yet touched on them; it is not steady or certain, but it is
bright and conspicuous. Ten years may last with me, though I have little
chance of it. At the end of this time these works will have operated a
clearance of debt, especially as Cadell offers to accommodate with such
money as their house can save to pay off what presses. I hope to save,
rather than otherwise, and if I leave my literary property to my
children, it will make a very good thing for them, and Abbotsford must
in any event go to my family, so, on the whole, I have only to pray for
quiet times, for how can men mind their serious business&mdash;that is,
according to Cadell's views&mdash;buying <i>Waverley Novels</i> when they are
going mad about the Catholic question. Dined at Mr. Nairne's, where
there was a great meeting of Bannatynians, rather too numerous, being on
the part of our host an Election dinner.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 7.&mdash;Sent away proofs. This extrication of my affairs, though
only a Pisgah prospect, occupies my mind more than is fitting; but
without some such hope I must have felt like one of the victims of the
wretch Burke, struggling against a smothering weight on my bosom, till
nature could endure it no longer. No; I will not be the sport of
circumstances. Come of it what will, &quot;I'll bend my brows like Highland
trows&quot; and make a bold fight of it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_246"></a>
<span>&quot;The best o't, the warst o't,<br /></span>
<span>Is only just to die.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And die I think I shall, though I am not such a coward as <i>mortem
conscire me ipso</i>. But I 'gin to grow aweary of the sun, and when the
plant no longer receives nourishment from light and air, there is a
speedy prospect of its withering.</p>

<p>Dined with the Banking Club of Scotland, in virtue of Sir Malachi
Malagrowther; splendid entertainment, of course. Sir John Hay in the
chair.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 8.&mdash;Spent the morning in reading proofs and additions to
<i>Magnum</i>. I got a note from Cadell, in which Ballantyne, by a letter
enclosed, totally condemns <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>&mdash;three volumes nearly
finished&mdash;a pretty thing, truly, for I will be expected to do it all
over again. Great dishonour in this, as Trinculo says,<a name="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a> besides an
infinite loss. Sent for Cadell to attend me next morning that we may
consult about this business. Peel has made his motion on the Catholic
question, with a speech of three hours. It is almost a complete
surrender to the Catholics, and so it should be, for half measures do
but linger out the feud. This will, or rather ought to, satisfy all men
who sincerely love peace, and therefore all men of property. But will
this satisfy Pat, who, with all his virtues, is certainly not the most
sensible person in the world? Perhaps not; and if not, it is but
fighting them at last. I smoked away, and thought of ticklish politics
and bad novels. Skene supped with us.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 9.&mdash;Cadell came to breakfast. We resolved in Privy Council to
refer the question whether <i>Anne of G&mdash;&mdash;n</i> be sea-worthy or not to
further consideration, which, as the <a name="Page_247"></a>book cannot be published, at any
rate, during the full rage of the Catholic question, may be easily
managed. After breakfast I went to Sir William Arbuthnot's,<a name="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a> and met
there a select party of Tories, to decide whether we should act with the
Whigs by owning their petition in favour of the Catholics. I was not
free from apprehension that the petition might be put into such general
language as I, at least, was unwilling to authenticate by my
subscription. The Solicitor<a name="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a> was voucher that they would keep the
terms quite general; whereupon we subscribed the requisition for a
meeting, with a slight alteration, affirming that it was our desire not
to have intermeddled, had not the anti-Catholics pursued that course;
and so the Whigs and we are embarked in the same boat, <i>vogue la
gal&egrave;re</i>.</p>

<p>Went about one o'clock to the Castle, where we saw the auld murderess
Mons Meg brought up there in solemn procession to reoccupy her ancient
place on the Argyle battery. Lady Hopetoun was my belle. The day was
cold but serene, and I think the ladies must have been cold enough, not
to mention the Celts, who turned out upon the occasion, under the
leading of Cluny Macpherson, a fine spirited lad. Mons Meg is a monument
of our pride and poverty. The size is immense, but six smaller guns
would have been made at the same expense, and done six times as much
execution as she could have done. There was immense interest taken in
the show by the people of the town, and the numbers who crowded the
Castle-hill had a magnificent appearance. About thirty of our Celts
attended in costume; and as there was a Highland regiment on duty, with
dragoons and artillerymen, the whole made a splendid show. The
<a name="Page_248"></a>dexterity with which the last manned and wrought the windlass which
raised old Meg, weighing seven or eight tons, from her temporary
carriage to that which has been her basis for many years, was singularly
beautiful as a combined exhibition of skill and strength. My daughter
had what might have proved a frightful accident. Some rockets were let
off, one of which lighted upon her head, and set her bonnet on fire. She
neither screamed nor ran, but quietly permitted Charles K. Sharpe to
extinguish the fire, which he did with great coolness and dexterity. All
who saw her, especially the friendly Celts, gave her merit for her
steadiness, and said she came of good blood. I was very glad and proud
of her presence of mind. My own courage was not put to the test, for
being at some distance, escorting the beautiful and lively Countess of
Hopetoun, I did not hear of the accident till it was over. We lunched
with the regiment (73d) now in the Castle. The little entertainment gave
me an opportunity of observing what I have often before remarked&mdash;the
improvement in the character of the young and subaltern officers in the
army, which in the course of a long and bloody war had been, in point of
rank and manners, something deteriorated. The number of persons applying
for commissions (3000 being now on the lists) gives an opportunity of
selection, and officers should certainly be <i>gentlemen</i>, with a complete
opening to all who can rise by merit. The style in which duty, and the
knowledge of their profession, is enforced, prevents <i>fain&eacute;ants</i> from
long remaining in the profession.</p>

<p>In the evening I presided at the Celtic Club, who received me with their
usual partiality. I like this society, and willingly give myself to be
excited by the sight of handsome young men with plaids and claymores,
and all the alertness and spirit of Highlanders in their native garb.
There was the usual degree of excitation&mdash;excellent dancing, capital
songs, a general inclination to please and to be <a name="Page_249"></a>pleased. A severe
cold, caught on the battlements of the Castle, prevented me from playing
first fiddle so well as usual, but what I could do was received with the
usual partiality of the Celts. I got home, fatigued and <i>vino gravatus</i>,
about eleven o'clock. We had many guests, some of whom, English
officers, seemed both amused and surprised at our wild ways, especially
at the dancing without ladies, and the mode of drinking favourite
toasts, by springing up with one foot on the bench and one on the table,
and the peculiar shriek of applause so unlike English cheering.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 10.&mdash;This may be a short day in the diary, though a busy one to
me. I arranged books and papers in the morning, and went to Court after
breakfast, where, as Sir Robert Dundas and I had the whole business to
discharge, I remained till two or three. Then visited Cadell, and
transacted some pecuniary matters.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 11, [<i>Abbotsford</i>].&mdash;I had, as usual, a sort of lev&eacute;e the day I
was to leave town, all petty bills and petty business being reserved to
the last by those who might as well have applied any one day of the
present month. But I need not complain of what happens to my betters,
for on the last day of the Session there pours into the Court a
succession of trifles which give the Court, and especially the Clerks,
much trouble, insomuch that a <i>ci-devant</i> brother of mine proposed that
the last day of the Session should be abolished by Statute. We got out
of Court at a quarter-past one, and got to Abbotsford at half-past
seven, cold and hungry enough to make Scots broth, English roast beef,
and a large fire very acceptable.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 12.&mdash;I set apart this day for trifles and dawdling; yet I
meditate doing something on the Popish and Protestant affray. I think I
could do some good, and I have the sincere wish to do it. I heard the
merry birds sing, reviewed my dogs, and was cheerful. I also unpacked
books. Deuce take arrangement! I think <a name="Page_250"></a>it the most complete bore in the
world; but I will try a little of it. I afterwards went out and walked
till dinner-time. I read Reginald Heber's Journal<a name="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> after dinner. I
spent some merry days with him at Oxford when he was writing his prize
poem. He was then a gay young fellow, a wit, and a satirist, and burning
for literary fame. My laurels were beginning to bloom, and we were both
madcaps. Who would have foretold our future lot?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Oh, little did my mither ken<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The day she cradled me<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><i>March</i> 13.&mdash;Wrought at a review of Fraser Tytler's <i>History of
Scotland</i>. It is somewhat saucy towards Lord Hailes. I had almost stuck
myself into the controversy Slough of Despond&mdash;the controversy, that is,
between the Gothic and Celtic system&mdash;but cast myself, like Christian,
with a strong struggle or two to the further side of this Slough; and
now will I walk on my way rejoicing&mdash;not on my article, however, but to
the fields. Came home and rejoiced at dinner. After tea I worked a
little more. I began to warm in my gear, and am about to awake the whole
controversy of Goth and Celt. I wish I may not make some careless
blunders.<a name="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>March</i> 14.&mdash;Up at eight, rather of the latest&mdash;then fagged at my
review, both before and after breakfast. I walked from one o'clock till
near three. I make it out, I think, rather better than of late I have
been able to do in the streets of Edinburgh, where I am ashamed to walk
so slow as would suit me. Indeed nothing but a certain suspicion, that
once drawn up on the beach I would soon break up, prevents me renouncing
pedestrian exercises altogether, for it is positive suffering, and of an
acute kind too.</p>
<a name="Page_251"></a>
<p><i>March</i> 15.&mdash;Altogether like yesterday. Wrote in the
morning&mdash;breakfasted&mdash;wrote again till one&mdash;out and walked about two
hours&mdash;to the quills once more&mdash;dinner&mdash;smoked a brace of cigars and
looked on the fire&mdash;a page of writing, and so to bed.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 16.&mdash;Day sullen and bitter cold. I fear it brings chilblains on
its wings. A dashing of snow, in thin flakes, wandering from the
horizon, and threatening a serious fall. As the murderer says to Banquo,
&quot;Let it come down!&quot;&mdash;we shall have the better chance of fair weather
hereafter. It cleared up, however, and I walked from one, or thereabout,
till within a quarter of four. A card from Mr. Dempster of Skibo,<a name="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a>
whose uncle, George Dempster, I knew many years since, a friend of
Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and all that set&mdash;a fine good-humoured old
gentleman. Young Mrs. Dempster is a daughter of my early friend and
patron, Robert Dundas of Arniston, Lord Advocate, and I like her for his
sake. Mr. Dempster is hunting, and I should have liked to have given his
wife and sister refuge during the time he must spend over moss and moor.
But the two Annes going to Edinburgh to a fancy ball makes it impossible
till they return on Friday night.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 17.&mdash;The Annes went off at eight, morning. After breakfast I
drove down to Melrose and waited on Mrs. and Miss Dempster, and engaged
them for Saturday. Weather bitter cold; yea, atrociously so.
Naboclish&mdash;the better for work. Ladies whose husbands love fox-hunting
are in a poor way. Here are two pleasant and pretty women pegged up the

</div></div>

<p><a name="Page_252"></a>for the whole twenty-four hours without interruption. They manage the
matter otherwise in France, where ladies are the lords of the ascendant.
I returned from my visit to my solitary work and solitary meal. I eked
out the last two hours' length by dint of smoking, which I find a
sedative without being a stimulant.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 18.&mdash;I like the hermit life indifferent well, nor would, I
sometimes think, break my heart, were I to be in that magic mountain
where food was regularly supplied by ministering genii,<a name="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> and plenty
of books were accessible without the least intervention of human
society. But this is thinking like a fool. Solitude is only agreeable
when the power of having society is removed to a short space, and can be
commanded at pleasure. &quot;It is not good for man to be alone.&quot; It blunts
our faculties and freezes our active virtues. And now, my watch pointing
to noon, I think after four hours' work I may indulge myself with a
walk. The dogs see me about to shut my desk, and intimate their
happiness by caresses and whining. By your leave, Messrs. Genii of the
Mountain library, if I come to your retreat I'll bring my dogs with me.</p>

<p>The day was showery, but not unpleasant&mdash;soft dropping rains, attended
by a mild atmosphere, that spoke of flowers in their seasons, and a
chirping of birds that had a touch of Spring in it. I had the patience
to get fully wet, and the grace to be thankful for it.</p>

<p>Come! a leetle flourish on the trumpet. Let us rouse the genius of this
same red mountain, so called because it is all the year covered with
roses. There can be no difficulty in finding it, for it lies towards the
Caspian, and is quoted in the Persian tales. Well, I open my
Ephemerides, form my scheme under the suitable planet, and the genie
obeys the invocation and appears.</p>

<p>Genie is a misshapen dwarf, with a huge jolter-head like <a name="Page_253"></a>that of
Boerhave on the Bridge,<a name="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a> his limbs and body marvellously shrunk and
disproportioned.</p>

<p>&quot;Sir Dwarf,&quot; said I, undauntedly, &quot;thy head is very large, and thy feet
and limbs somewhat small in proportion.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Genie</i>. &quot;I have crammed my head, even to the overflowing, with
knowledge; I have starved my limbs by disuse of exercise and denial of
sustenance!&quot;</p>

<p><i>Author</i>. &quot;Can I acquire wisdom in thy solitary library?&quot;</p>

<p><i>G</i>. &quot;Thou mayest!&quot;</p>

<p><i>A</i>. &quot;On what conditions?&quot;</p>

<p><i>G</i>. &quot;Renounce all gross and fleshly pleasure, eat pulse and drink
water, converse with none but the wise and learned, alive and dead!&quot;</p>

<p><i>A</i>. &quot;Why, this were to die in the cause of wisdom.&quot;</p>

<p><i>G</i>. &quot;If you desire to draw from our library only the advantage of
seeming wise, you may have it consistent with all your favourite
enjoyments!&quot;</p>

<p><i>A</i>. &quot;How much sleep?&quot;</p>

<p><i>G</i>. &quot;A Lapland night&mdash;eight months out of the twelve!&quot;</p>

<p><i>A</i>. &quot;Enough for a dormouse, most generous Genius.&mdash;A bottle of wine?&quot;</p>

<p><i>G</i>. &quot;Two, if you please; but you must not seem to care for them&mdash;cigars
in loads, whisky in lashings; but they must be taken with an air of
contempt, a <i>floccipaucinihilipilification</i> of all that can gratify the
outward man.&quot;</p>

<p><i>A</i>. &quot;I am about to ask you a serious question&mdash;When you have stuffed
your stomach, drunk your bottle, smoked your cigar, how are you to keep
yourself awake?&quot;</p>

<p><i>G</i>. &quot;Either by cephalic snuff or castle-building!&quot;</p>
<a name="Page_254"></a>
<p><i>A.</i> &quot;Do you approve of castle-building as a frequent exercise?&quot;</p>

<p><i>G.</i> &quot;Life were not life without it!</p>

<p><i>A.</i> &quot;I reckon myself one of the best a&euml;rial architects now living, and

<p><i>G.</i> &quot;<i>Nec est cur te p&aelig;niteat</i>; most of your novels have previously
been subjects for airy castles.&quot;</p>

<p><i>A.</i> &quot;You have me&mdash;and moreover a man of imagination derives experience
from such imaginary situations. There are few situations in which I have
not in fancy figured, and there are few, of course, which I am not
previously prepared to take some part in.&quot;</p>

<p><i>G.</i> &quot;True, but I am afraid your having fancied yourself victorious in
many a fight would be of little use were you suddenly called to the
field, and your personal infirmities and nervous agitations both rushing
upon you and incapacitating you.&quot;</p>

<p><i>A.</i> &quot;My nervous agitations!&mdash;away with thee! Down, down to Limbo and
the burning lake! False fiend, avoid!&quot;</p>

<p><i>March</i> 19.&mdash;The above was written yesterday before dinner, though
appearances are to the contrary. I only meant that the studious solitude
I have sometimes dreamed of, unless practised with rare stoicism and
privation, was apt to degenerate into secret sensual indulgences of
coarser appetites, which, when the cares and restraints of social life
are removed, are apt to make us think, with Dr.<a name="Page_255"></a> Johnson, our dinner the
most important event of the day. So much in the way of explanation&mdash;a
humour which I love not. Go to.</p>

<p>My girls returned from Edinburgh with full news of their <i>bal par&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 20.&mdash;We spent this day on the same terms as formerly. I wrought,
walked, dined, drank, and smoked upon the same pattern.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 21.&mdash;To-day brought Mrs. Dempster and her sister-in-law. To
dinner came Robert Dundas of Arniston from the hunting-field, and with
him Mr. Dempster of Skibo, both favourites of mine. Mr. Stuart, the
grand-nephew of my dear friend Lady Louisa, also dined with us, together
with the Lyons from Gattonside, and the day passed over in hospitality
and social happiness.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 22.&mdash;Being Sunday, I read prayers to our guests, then went a
long walk by the lake to Huntly Burn. It is somewhat uncomfortable to
feel difficulties increase and the strength to meet them diminish. But
why should man fret? While iron is dissolved by rust, and brass
corrodes, can our dreams be of flesh and blood enduring? But I will not
dwell on this depressing subject. My liking to my two young guests is
founded on &quot;things that are long enough ago.&quot; The first statesman of
celebrity whom I personally knew was Mr. Dempster's grand-uncle, George
Dempster of Dunnichen, celebrated in his time, and Dundas's father was,
when Lord Advocate, the first man of influence who showed kindness to
me.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 23.&mdash;Arrived to breakfast one of the Courland nobility, Baron A.
von Meyersdorff, a fine, lively, spirited young man, fond of his country
and incensed at its degradation under Russia. He talked much of the
orders of chivalry who had been feudal lords of Livonia, especially the
order of Porte Glaive, to which his own ancestors had belonged. If he
report correctly, there is a deep principle of action at <a name="Page_256"></a>work in
Germany, Poland, Russia, etc., which, if it does &quot;not die in thinking,&quot;
will one day make an explosion. The Germans are a nation, however, apt
to exhaust themselves in speculation. The Baron has enthusiasm, and is
well read in English and foreign literature. I kept my state till one,
and wrote notes to Croker upon Boswell's Scottish tour. It was an act of
friendship, for time is something of a scarce article with me. But
Croker has been at all times personally kind and actively serviceable to
me, and he must always command my best assistance. Then I walked with
the Baron as far as the Lake. Our sportsmen came in good time to dinner,
and our afternoon was pleasant.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 24.&mdash;This morning our sportsmen took leave, and their <i>ladykind</i>
(to <i>rench&eacute;rir</i> on Anthony a-Wood and Mr. Oldbuck) followed after
breakfast, and I went to my work till one, and at that hour treated the
Baron to another long walk, with which he seemed highly delighted. He
tells me that my old friend the Princess Galitzin<a name="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> is dead. After
dinner I had a passing visit from Kinnear, to bid me farewell. This very
able and intelligent young man, so able to throw a grace over commercial
pursuits, by uniting them with literature, is going with his family to
settle in London. I do not wonder at it. His parts are of a kind
superior to the confined sphere in which he moves in Scotland. In
London, he says, there is a rapid increase of business and its
opportunities. Thus London licks the butter off our bread, by opening a
better market for ambition. Were it not for the difference of the
religion and laws, poor Scotland could hardly keep a man that is worth
having; and yet men will not see this. I took leave of Kinnear, with
hopes for his happiness and fortune, but yet with some regret for the
<a name="Page_257"></a>sake of the country which loses him. The Baron agreed to go with
Kinnear to Kelso: and <i>exit</i> with the usual demonstrations of German
enthusiasm.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 25.&mdash;I worked in the morning, and think I have sent Croker a
packet which may be useful, and to Lockhart a critique on rather a dry
topic, viz.: the ancient Scottish History. I remember E. Ainslie,
commonly called the plain man, who piqued himself on his powers of
conversation, striving to strike fire from some old flinty wretch whom
he found in a corner of a public coach, at length addressed him:
&quot;Friend, I have tried you on politics, literary matters, religion,
fashionable news, etc. etc., and all to no purpose.&quot; The dry old rogue,
twisting his muzzle into an infernal grin, replied, &quot;Can you claver
about bend leather?&quot; The man, be it understood, was a leather merchant.
The early history of Caledonia is almost as hopeless a subject, but off
it goes. I walked up the Glen with Tom for my companion. Dined, heard
Anne reading a paper of anecdotes about Cluny Macpherson, and so to bed.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 26.&mdash;As I have been so lately Johnsonizing, I should derive, if
possible, some personal use. Johnson advises Boswell to keep a diary,
and to omit registers of the weather, and like trumpery. I am resolved
in future not to register what is yet more futile&mdash;my gleams of bright
and clouded temper. Boswell&mdash;whose nerves were, one half madness, and
half affectation&mdash;has thrummed upon this topic till it is threadbare. I
have at this moment forty things to do, and great inclination to do none
of them. I ended by working till two, walking till five, writing
letters, and so to bed.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 27.&mdash;Letters again. Let me see. I wrote to Lord Montagu about
Scott of Beirlaw's commission, in which Invernahyle interests himself.
Item, to a lady who is pestering me about a Miss Campbell sentenced to
transportation for stealing a silver spoon. Item, to<a name="Page_258"></a> John Eckford.
Item, to James Loch, to get an appointment for Sandie Ballantyne's son.
Not one, as Dangle says,<a name="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> about any business of my own. My
correspondence is on a most disinterested footing. This lasts till past
eleven, then enters my cousin R., and remains for two hours, till
politics, family news, talk of the neighbourhood are all exhausted, and
two or three reputations torn to pieces in the scouring of them. At
length I walk him out about a mile, and come back from that
<i>emp&ecirc;chement</i>. But it is only to find Mr. [Henry] C[ranstoun],<a name="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> my
neighbour, in the parlour with the girls, and there is another sederunt
of an hour. Well, such things must be, and our friends mean them as
civility, and we must take and give the currency of the country. But I
am <i>diddled</i> out of a day all the same. The ladies came from Huntly
Burn, and cut off the evening.<a name="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>March</i> 28.&mdash;In spite of the temptation of a fine morning, I toiled
manfully at the <i>review</i> till two o'clock, commencing at seven. I fear
it will be uninteresting, but I like the <a name="Page_259"></a>muddling work of antiquities,
and, besides, wish to record my sentiments with regard to the Gothic
question. No one that has not laboured as I have done on imaginary
topics can judge of the comfort afforded by walking on all-fours, and
being grave and dull. I dare say, when the clown of the pantomime
escapes from his nightly task of vivacity, it is his special comfort to
smoke a pipe and be prosy with some good-natured fellow, the dullest of
his acquaintance. I have seen such a tendency in Sir Adam Ferguson, the
gayest man I ever knew; and poor Tom Sheridan has complained to me of
the fatigue of supporting the character of an agreeable companion.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 29.&mdash;I wrote, read, and walked with the most stoical regularity.
This muddling among old books has the quality of a sedative, and saves
the tear and wear of an overwrought brain. I wandered on the hills
pleasantly enough and concluded a pleasant and laborious day.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 30.&mdash;I finished the remainder of the criticism and sent it off.
Pray Heaven it break not the mail coach down.</p>

<p>Lord and Lady Dalhousie, and their relation, Miss Hawthorne, came to
dinner, to meet whom we had Dr. and Mrs. Brewster. Lord Dalhousie has
more of the Caledonian <i>prisca fides</i> than any man I know now alive. He
has served his country in all quarters of the world and in every
climate; yet, though my contemporary, looks ten years my junior. He
laughed at the idea of rigid temperance, and held an occasional skirmish
no bad thing even in the West Indies, thinking, perhaps, with Armstrong,
of &quot;the rare debauch&quot;<a name="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a>. In all incidents of life he has been the
same steady, honest, true-hearted Lord Dalhousie, that Lordie Ramsay
promised to be when at the High School. How few such can I remember, and
how poorly have honesty and valour been rewarded! Here, at the time when
most men think of <a name="Page_260"></a>repose, he is bundled off to command in India.<a name="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a>
Would it had been the Chief Governorship! But to have remained at home
would have been bare livelihood, and that is all. I asked him what he
thought of &quot;strangling a nabob, and rifling his jewel closet,&quot; and he
answered, &quot;No, no, an honest man.&quot; I fear we must add, a poor one. Lady
Dalhousie, formerly Miss Brown of Coalstoun, is an amiable, intelligent,
and lively woman, who does not permit society to &quot;cream and mantle like
a standing pool.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a></p>

<p>The weather, drifting and surly, does not permit us to think of Melrose,
and I could only fight round the thicket with Dr. Brewster and his
lordship. Lord Dalhousie gave me some interesting accounts of the
American Indians. They are, according to his lordship, decaying fast in
numbers and principle. Lord Selkirk's property now makes large returns,
from the stock of the North West Company and Hudson's Bay Companies
having united. I learned from Lord Dalhousie that he had been keeping a
diary since the year 1800. Should his narrative ever see the light, what
a contrast will it form to the flourishing vapouring accounts of most of
the French merchants! Mr. and Mrs. Skene with their daughter Kitty, who
has been indisposed, came to dinner, and the party was a well-assorted
one.</p>
<a name="Page_261"></a>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="APRIL_1829"></a><h2>APRIL.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>April 1</i>.&mdash;A pretty first of April truly; the hills white with snow, I
myself as bilious as a dog. My noble guests left about noon. I wrote
letters, as if I had not bile enough in my bosom already, and did not go
out to face the snow wreaths till half-past two, when I am resolved to
make a brush for exercise. There will be fine howling among the dogs,
for I am about to shut my desk. Found Mrs. Skene disposed to walk, so I
had the advantage of her company. The snow lay three inches thick on the
ground; but we had the better appetite for dinner, after which we talked
and read without my lifting a pen.</p>

<p><i>April 2</i>.&mdash;Begins with same brilliant prospect of snow and sunshine
dazzling to the eyes and chilling to the fingers, a beastly disagreeable
coldness in the air. I stuck by the pen till one, then took a drive with
the ladies as far as Chiefswood and walked home. Young William
Forbes<a name="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> came, and along with him a Southron, Mr. Cleasby.</p>

<p><i>April 3</i>.&mdash;Still the same party. I fagged at writing letters to
Lockhart, to Charles, and to John Gibson, to Mr. Cadell, Croker, Lord
Haddington, and others. Lockhart has had an overture through Croker
requesting him to communicate with some newspaper on the part of the
Government, which he has wisely declined. Nothing but a <a name="Page_262"></a>thorough-going
blackguard ought to attempt the daily press, unless it is some quiet
country diurnal. Lockhart has also a wicked wit which would make an
office of this kind more dangerous to him than to downright dulness. I
am heartily glad he has refused it.<a name="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a></p>

<p>Sir James Mackintosh and Lord Haddington have spoken very handsomely of
my accession to the Catholic Petition, and I think it has done some
good; yet I am not confident that the measure will disarm the Catholic
spleen.<a name="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> And I was not entirely easy at finding myself allied to the
Whigs, even in this instance, where I agree with them. This is witless
prejudice, however.</p>

<p>My walk to-day was up the Rhymer's Glen with Skene. Colonel Ferguson
dined with us.</p>
<a name="Page_263"></a>
<p><i>April</i> 4.&mdash;Mr. Cleasby left this morning. He has travelled much, and is
a young man of copious conversation and ready language, aiming I suppose
at Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a> William Forbes is singing like an angel in the next
room, but he sings only Italian music, which says naught to me. I have a
letter from one David Patterson, who was Dr. Knox's jackal for buying
murdered bodies, suggesting that I should write on the subject of Burke
and Hare, and offering me his invaluable collection of anecdotes! &quot;Curse
him imperance and him dam insurance,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> as Mungo says in the farce.
Did ever one hear the like? The scoundrel has been the companion and
patron of such atrocious murderers and kidnappers, and he has the
impudence to write to any decent man!</p>

<p>Corrected proof-sheets and dedication of the <i>Magnum</i> and sent them off.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 5.&mdash;Read prayers to what remains of our party: being Anne, my
niece Anne, the four Skenes, and William Forbes. We then walked, and I
returned time enough to work a little at the criticism. Thus it drew
towards dinner in conclusion, after which we smoked, told stories, and
drank tea.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 6.&mdash;Worked at the <i>review</i> for three or four hours; yet hang it,
I can't get on. I wonder if I am turning clumsy in other matters;
certainly I cannot write against time as I used to do. My thoughts will
not be duly regulated; my pen declares for itself, will neither write
nor spell, and goes under independent colours. I went out with the child
Kitty Skene on her pony. I don't much love children, I suppose from want
of habit, but this is a fine merry little girl.</p>

<p>William Forbes sang in the evening with a feeling and <a name="Page_264"></a>taste
indescribably fine, but as he had no Scottish or English songs, my ears
were not much gratified. I have no sense beyond Mungo: &quot;What signify me
hear if me no understand!&quot;</p>

<p>William Forbes leaves us. As to the old story, scribble till two, then
walk for exercise till four. Deil hae it else, for company eats up the
afternoon, so nothing can be done that is not achieved in the forenoon.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 7.&mdash;We had a gay scene this morning&mdash;the foxhounds and merry
hunters in my little base court, which rung with trampling steeds, and
rejoiced in scarlet jackets and ringing horns. I have seen the day
worlds would not have bribed me to stay behind them; but that is over,
and I walked a sober pace up to the Abbot's Knowe, from which I saw them
draw my woods, but without finding a fox. I watched them with that
mixture of interest, affection, and compassion which old men feel at
looking on the amusements of the young. I was so far interested in the
chase itself as to be sorry they did not find. I had so far the
advantage of the visit, that it gave me an object for the morning
exercise, which I would otherwise only have been prompted to by health
and habit. It is pleasant to have one's walk,&mdash;as heralds say, with a
difference. By the way, the foxhunters hunted the cover far too fast.
When they found a path they ran through it pell-mell without beating at
all. They had hardly left the hare-hole cover, when a fox, which they
had over-run, stole away. This is the consequence of breeding dogs too
speedy.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 8.&mdash;We have the news of the Catholic question being carried in
the House of Lords, by a majority of 105 upon the second reading. This
is decisive, and the balsam of Fierabras must be swallowed.<a name="FNanchor_291_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_292"><sup>[291]</sup></a> It
remains to see how it will work. Since it was indubitably necessary, I
am glad the decision on the case has been complete. On these last three
days I have finished my review of Tytler for Lockhart and sent it off by
this post. I may have offended Peter by <a name="Page_265"></a>censuring him for a sort of
petulance towards his predecessor Lord Hailes. This day visited by Mr.
Carr, who is a sensible, clever young man, and by his two
sisters<a name="FNanchor_292_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_293"><sup>[292]</sup></a>&mdash;beautiful singer the youngest&mdash;and to my taste, and
English music.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 9.&mdash;Laboured correcting proofs and revising; the day infinitely
bad. Worked till three o'clock; then tried a late walk, and a wet one.</p>

<p>I hear bad news of James Ballantyne. Hypochondriac I am afraid, and
religiously distressed in mind.</p>

<p>I got a book from the Duke de L&eacute;vis, the same gentleman with whom I had
an awkward meeting at Abbotsford, owing to his having forgot his
credentials, which left me at an unpleasant doubt as to his character
and identity.<a name="FNanchor_293_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_294"><sup>[293]</sup></a> His book is inscribed to me with hyperbolical
praises. Now I don't like to have, like the Persian poets who have the
luck to please the Sun of the Universe, my mouth crammed with
sugar-candy, which politeness will not permit me to spit out, and my
stomach is indisposed to swallow. The book is better than would be
expected from the exaggerated nonsense of the dedication.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 10.&mdash;Left Abbotsford at seven to attend the Circuit. <i>Nota
bene</i>&mdash;half-past six is the better hour; waters are extremely flooded.
Lord Meadowbank at the Circuit. Nothing tried but a few trumpery
assaults. Meadowbank announces he will breakfast with me to-morrow, so I
shall return to-night. Promised to my cousin Charles Scott to interest
myself about his getting the farm of Milsington upon <a name="Page_266"></a>Borthwick Water
and mentioned him to Colonel Riddell as a proposed offerer. The tender
was well received. I saw James the piper and my cousin Anne; sent to
James Veitch the spyglass of Professor Ferguson to be repaired. Dined
with the Judge and returned in the evening.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 11.&mdash;Meadowbank breakfasted with us, and then went on to
Edinburgh, pressed by bad news of his family. His wife (daughter of my
early patron, President Blair) is very ill; indeed I fear fatally so. I
am sorry to think it is so. When the King was here she was the finest
woman I saw at Holyrood. My proofs kept me working till two; then I had
a fatiguing and watery walk. After dinner we smoked, and I talked with
Mr. Carr over criminal jurisprudence, the choicest of conversation to an
old lawyer; and the delightful music of Miss Isabella Carr closed the
day. Still, I don't get to my task; but I will, to-morrow or next day.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 12.&mdash;Read prayers, put my books in order and made some progress
in putting papers in order which have been multiplying on my table. I
have a letter from that impudent lad Reynolds about my contribution to
the <i>Keepsake</i>. Sent to him the <i>House of Aspen</i>, as I had previously
determined. This will give them a lumping pennyworth in point of extent,
but that's the side I would have the bargain rest upon. It shall be a
warning after this to keep out of such a scrape.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 13.&mdash;In the morning before breakfast I corrected the proof of
the critique on the life of Lord Pitsligo in Blackwood's Magazine.<a name="FNanchor_294_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_295"><sup>[294]</sup></a>
After breakfast Skene and his lady and family, and Mr. Carr and his
sisters, took their departure. Time was dawdled away till nearly twelve
o'clock and then I could not work much. I finished, however, a painful
letter to J. Ballantyne, which I hope will have effect upon the nervous
disorder he complains of. He must &quot;awake, arise, or be for ever fallen.&quot;
I walked <a name="Page_267"></a>happily and pleasantly from two o'clock till four. And now I
must look to <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>. Hang it! it is not so bad after all,
though I fear it will not be popular. In fact, I am almost expended; but
while I exhort others to exertion I will not fail to exert myself. I
have a letter from R.P. G[illies] proposing to subscribe to assist him
from &pound;25 to &pound;50. It will do no good, but yet I cannot help giving him
something.</p>

<p>I will try a review for the <i>Foreign</i> and he shall have the proceeds.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 14.&mdash;I sent off proofs of the review of Tytler for John
Lockhart. Then set a stout heart to a stay brae, and took up <i>Anne of
Geierstein</i>. I had five sheets standing by me, which I read with care,
and satisfied myself that worse had succeeded, but it was while the
fashion of the thing was new. I retrenched a good deal about the
Troubadours, which was really <i>hors de place</i>. As to King Ren&eacute;, I
retained him as a historical character. In short, I will let the sheets
go nearly as they are, for though J.B. be an excellent judge of this
species of composition, he is not infallible, and has been in
circumstances which may cross his mind. I might have taken this
determination a month since, and I wish I had. But I thought I might
strike out something better by the braes and burn-sides. Alas! I walk
along them with painful and feeble steps, and invoke their influence in
vain. But my health is excellent, and it were ungrateful to complain
either of mental or bodily decay. We called at Elliston to-day and made
up for some ill-bred delay. In the evening I corrected two sheets of the
<i>Magnum</i>, as we call it.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 15.&mdash;I took up <i>Anne</i>, and wrote, with interruption of a nap (in
which my readers may do well to <a name="Page_268"></a>imitate me), till two o'clock. I wrote
with care, having digested Comines. Whether I succeed or not, it would
be dastardly to give in. A bold countenance often carries off an
indifferent cause, but no one will defend him who shows the white
feather. At two I walked till near four. Dined with the girls, smoked
two cigars, and to work again till supper-time. Slept like a top. Amount
of the day's work, eight pages&mdash;a round task.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 16.&mdash;I meant to go out with Bogie to plant some shrubs in front
of the old quarry, but it rains cats and dogs as they say, a rare day
for grinding away at the old mill of imagination, yet somehow I have no
great will to the task. After all, however, the morning proved a true
April one, sunshine and shower, and I both worked to some purpose, and
moreover walked and directed about planting the quarry.</p>

<p>The post brought matter for a May or April morning&mdash;a letter from Sir
James Mackintosh, telling me that Moore and he were engaged as
contributors to Longman's Encyclop&aelig;dia, and asking me to do a volume at
&pound;1000, the subject to be the History of Scotland in one volume. This
would be very easy work. I have the whole stuff in my head, and could
write <i>currente calamo</i>. The size is as I compute it about one-third
larger than <i>The Tales of my Grandfather</i>. There is much to be said on
both sides. Let me balance pros and cons after the fashion of honest
Robinson Crusoe. <i>Pro.</i>&mdash;It is the sum I have been wishing for,
sufficient to enable me to break the invisible but magic circle which
petty debts of myself and others have traced round me. With common
prudence I need no longer go from hand to mouth, or what is worse,
anticipate my means. I may also pay off some small shop debts, etc.,
belonging to the Trust, clear off all Anne's embarrassment, and even
make some foundation of a purse for her. <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;I think this whacking
reason is like to prove the gallon of Cognac brandy, which a lady
recommended as the foundation of a Liqueur. &quot;Stop, dear <a name="Page_269"></a>madam, if you
please,&quot; said my grandfather, Dr. Rutherford, &quot;you can [add] nothing to
that; it is <i>flaconnad&eacute;</i> with &pound;1000,&quot; and a capital hit, egad.
<i>Contra.</i>&mdash;It is terribly like a hack author to make an abridgement of
what I have written so lately. <i>Pro.</i>&mdash;But a difference may be taken. A
history may be written of the same country on a different plan, general
where the other is detailed, and philosophical where it is popular. I
think I can do this, and do it with unwashed hands too. For being
hacked, what is it but another word for being an author? I will take
care of my name doubtless, but the five letters which form it must take
care of me in turn. I never knew name or fame burn brighter by over
chary keeping of it. Besides, there are two gallant hacks to pull with
me. <i>Contra.</i>&mdash;I have a monstrous deal on hand. Let me see: Life of
Argyll,<a name="FNanchor_296_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_297"><sup>[296]</sup></a> and Life of Peterborough for Lockhart.<a name="FNanchor_297_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_298"><sup>[297]</sup></a> Third series
<i>Tales of my Grandfather</i>&mdash;review for Gillies&mdash;new novel&mdash;end of <i>Anne
of Geierstein</i>. <i>Pro.</i>&mdash;But I have just finished too long reviews for
Lockhart. The third series is soon discussed. The review may be finished
in three or four days, and the novel is within a week and less of
conclusion. For the next, we must first see how this goes off. In fine,
within six weeks, I am sure I can do the work and secure the
independence I sigh for. Must I not make hay while the sun shines? Who
can tell what leisure, health, and life may be destined to me?</p>

<p>Adjourned the debate till to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 17.&mdash;I resumed the discussion of the bargain about the history.
The ayes to the right, the noes to the left. The ayes have it&mdash;so I will
write to Sir James of this date. But I will take a walk first, that I
will. A little shaken with the conflict, for after all were I as I have
been&mdash;&mdash;. &quot;My poverty but not my will consents.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_298_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_299"><sup>[298]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_270"></a>
<p>I have been out in a most delicious real spring day. I returned with my
nerves strung and my mind determined. I will make this plunge, and with
little doubt of coming off no loser in character. What is given in
detail may be suppressed, general views may be enlarged upon, and a
bird's-eye prospect given, not the less interesting, that we have seen
its prominent points nearer and in detail. I have been of late in a
great degree free from wafered letters, sums to make up, notes of hand
wanted, and all the worry of an embarrassed man's life. This last
struggle will free me entirely, and so help me Heaven it shall be made!
I have written to Sir James, stating that I apprehend the terms to be
&pound;1000, namely, for one volume containing about one-third more than one
of the volumes of <i>Tales of my Grandfather</i>, and agreeing to do so.
Certes, few men can win a thousand pounds so readily.</p>

<p>We dine with the Fergusons to-day at four. So off we went and safely
returned.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 18.&mdash;Corrected proofs. I find J.B. has not returned to his
business, though I wrote him how necessary it was. My pity begins to
give way to anger. Must he sit there and squander his thoughts and
senses upon cloudy metaphysics and abstruse theology till he addles his
brains entirely, and ruins his business? I have written to him again,
letter third and, I am determined, last.</p>

<p>Wrote also to the fop Reynolds, with preface to the <i>House of Aspen</i>,
then to honest Joseph Train desiring he would give me some notion how to
serve him with Messrs. Carr, and to take care to make his ambition
moderate and feasible.</p>

<p>My neighbour, Mr. Kerr of Kippielaw, struck with a palsy while he was
looking at the hounds; his pony remained standing by his side. A sudden
call if a final one.</p>

<p>That strange desire to leave a prescribed task and set about something
else seized me irresistibly. I yielded to it, and sat down to try at
what speed and in what manner I could execute this job of Sir James
Mackintosh's, and I <a name="Page_271"></a>wrote three leaves before rising, well enough, I
think. The girls made a round with me. We drove to Chiefswood, and from
that to Janeswood, up the Rhymer's Glen, and so home. This occupied from
one to four. In the evening I heard Anne read Mr. Peel's excellent Bill
on the Police of the Metropolis, which goes to disband the whole
generation of Dogberry and Verges. Wrote after tea.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 19.&mdash;I made this a busy day. I wrote on at the history until two
o'clock, then took a gallant walk, then began reading for Gillies's
article. James Ferguson dined with us. We smoked and I became woundy
sleepy. Now I have taken collar to this arrangement, I find an open sea
before me which I could not have anticipated, for though I should get
through well enough with my expectations during the year, yet it is a
great thing to have a certainty to be clear as a new pin of every penny
of debt. There is no being obliged or asking favours or getting loans
from some grudging friend who can never look at you after but with fear
of losing his cash, or you at him without the humiliating sense of
having extorted an obligation. Besides my large debts, I have paid since
I was in trouble at least &pound;2000 of personal encumbrances, so no wonder
my nose is still under water. I really believe the sense of this
apparently unending struggle, schemes for retrenchment in which I was
unseconded, made me low-spirited, for the sun seems to shine brighter
upon me as a free man. Nevertheless, devil take the necessity which
makes me drudge like a very hack of Grub Street.</p>

</div></div>

<p>I walked out with Tom's assistance, came home, went through the weary
work of cramming, and so forth; wrought after tea, and then to bed.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 20.&mdash;As yesterday till two&mdash;sixteen pages of the History
written, and not less than one-fifth of the whole <a name="Page_272"></a>book. What if they
should be off? I were finely holp'd for throwing my time away. A toy!
They dare not.</p>

<p>Lord Buchan is dead, a person whose immense vanity, bordering upon
insanity, obscured, or rather eclipsed, very considerable talents. His
imagination was so fertile that he seemed really to believe the
extraordinary fictions which he delighted in telling. His economy, most
laudable in the early part of his life, when it enabled him, from a
small income, to pay his father's debts, became a miserable habit, and
led him to do mean things. He had a desire to be a great man, and a
<i>M&aelig;cenas bon march&eacute;</i>. The two celebrated lawyers, his brothers, were not
more gifted by nature than I think he was, but the restraints of a
profession kept the eccentricity of the family in order. Henry Erskine
was the best-natured man I ever knew, thoroughly a gentleman, and with
but one fault: he could not say <i>no</i>, and thus sometimes misled those
who trusted him. Tom Erskine was positively mad. I have heard him tell a
cock-and-a-bull story of having seen the ghost of his father's servant,
John Burnet, with as much sincerity as if he believed every word he was
saying. Both Henry and Thomas were saving men, yet both died very poor.
The one at one time possessed &pound;200,000; the other had a considerable
fortune. The Earl alone has died wealthy. It is saving, not getting,
that is the mother of riches. They all had wit. The Earl's was
crack-brained and sometimes caustic; Henry's was of the very kindest,
best-humoured, and gayest that ever cheered society; that of Lord
Erskine was moody and maddish. But I never saw him in his best days.</p>

<p>Went to Haining. Time has at last touched the beautiful Mrs. Pringle. I
wonder he was not ashamed of himself for spoiling so fine a form. But
what cares he? Corrected proofs after dinner. James B. is at last at
work again.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 21.&mdash;Spent the whole morning at writing, still the History, such
is my wilful whim. Twenty pages now <a name="Page_273"></a>finished&mdash;I suppose the clear
fourth part of a volume. I went out, but the day being sulky I sat in
the Conservatory, after trying a walk! I have been glancing over the
works for Gillies's review, and I think on them between-hands while I
compose the History,&mdash;an odd habit of doing two things at once, but it
has always answered with me well enough.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 22.&mdash;Another hard day's work at the History, now increased to
the Bruce and Baliol period, and threatening to be too lengthy for the
Cyclop&aelig;dia. But I will make short work with wars and battles. I wrote
till two o'clock, and strolled with old Tom and my dogs<a name="FNanchor_300_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_301"><sup>[300]</sup></a> till
half-past four, hours of pleasure and healthful exercise, and to-day
taken with ease. A letter from J.B., stating an alarm that he may lose
the printing of a part of the <i>Magnum</i>. But I shall write him he must be
his own friend, set shoulder to the wheel, and remain at the head of his
business; and of that I must make him aware. And so I set to my proofs.
&quot;Better to work,&quot; says the inscription on Hogarth's Bridewell, &quot;than
stand thus.&quot;</p>

<p><i>April</i> 23.&mdash;A cold blustering day&mdash;bad welcome for the poor lambs. I
made my walk short and my task long, my work turning entirely on the
History&mdash;all on speculation. But the post brought me a letter from Dr.
Lardner, the manager of the Cyclop&aelig;dia, agreeing to my terms; so all is
right there, and no labour thrown away. The volume is to run to 400
pages; so much the better; I love elbow-room, <a name="Page_274"></a>and will have space to do
something to purpose. I replied agreeing to his terms, and will send him
copy as soon as I have corrected it. The Colonel and Miss Ferguson dined
with us. I think I drank rather a cheerful glass with my good friend.
Smoked an extra cigar, so no more at present.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 25.&mdash;After writing to Mr. Cochrane,<a name="FNanchor_301_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_302"><sup>[301]</sup></a> to Cadell and J.B.,
also to Mr. Pitcairn,<a name="FNanchor_302_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_303"><sup>[302]</sup></a> it was time to set out for Lord Buchan's
funeral. The funeral letters were signed by Mr. H. David Erskine, his
lordship's natural son. His nephew, the young Earl, was present, but
neither of them took the head of the coffin. His lordship's funeral took
place in a chapel amongst the ruins. His body was in the grave with its
feet pointing westward. My cousin, Maxpopple,<a name="FNanchor_303_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_304"><sup>[303]</sup></a> was for taking notice
of it, but I assured him that a man who had been wrong in the head all
his life would scarce become right-headed after death. I felt something
at parting with this old man, though but a trumpery body. He gave me the
first approbation I ever obtained from a stranger. His caprice had led
him to examine Dr. Adam's class when I, a boy twelve years old, and then
in disgrace for some aggravated case of negligence, was called up from a
low bench, and recited my lesson with some spirit and appearance of
feeling the poetry&mdash;it was the apparition of Hector's ghost in the
&AElig;neid&mdash;of which called forth the noble Earl's applause. I was very proud
of this at the time.</p>

<p>I was sad on another account&mdash;it was the first time I had been among
these ruins since I left a very valued pledge there. My next visit may
be involuntary. Even so, God's will be done! at least I have not the
mortification of thinking what a deal of patronage and fuss Lord Buchan
would bestow on <a name="Page_275"></a>my funeral.<a name="FNanchor_304_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_305"><sup>[304]</sup></a> Maxpopple dined and slept here with
four of his family, much amused with what they heard and saw. By good
fortune a ventriloquist and partial juggler came in, and we had him in
the library after dinner. He was a half-starved wretched-looking
creature, who seemed to have ate more fire than bread. So I caused him
to be well stuffed, and gave him a guinea, rather to his poverty than to
his skill&mdash;and now to finish <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 26.&mdash;But not a finger did I lay on the jacket of <i>Anne</i>. Looking
for something, I fell in with the little drama, long missing, called the
<i>Doom of Devorgoil</i>. I believe it was out of mere contradiction that I
sat down to read and correct it, merely because I would not be bound to
do aught that seemed compulsory. So I scribbled at a piece of nonsense
till two o'clock, and then walked to the lake. At night I flung helve
after hatchet, and spent the evening in reading the <i>Doom of Devorgoil</i>
to the girls, who seemed considerably interested. Anne objects to the
mingling the goblinry, which is comic, with the serious, which is
tragic. After all, I could greatly improve it, and it would not be a bad
composition of that odd kind to some picnic receptacle of all things.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 27.&mdash;This day must not be wasted. I breakfast with the
Fergusons, and dine with the Brewsters. But, by Heaven, I will finish
<i>Anne of Geierstein</i> this day betwixt the two engagements. I don't know
why nor wherefore, but I hate <i>Anne</i>, I mean <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>; the
other two Annes are good girls. Accordingly I well nigh accomplished my
work, but about three o'clock my story fell into a slough, and in
getting it out I lost my way, and was forced to postpone the conclusion
till to-morrow. Wrote a good day's work notwithstanding.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 28.&mdash;I have slept upon my puzzle, and will now finish it, Jove
bless my <i>pia mater</i>, as I see not further impediment before me. The
story will end, and shall end, because it must end, and so here goes.
After this doughty <a name="Page_276"></a>resolution, I went doggedly to work, and finished
five leaves by the time when they should meet the coach. But the
misfortune of writing fast is that one cannot at the same time write
concisely. I wrote two pages more in the evening. Stayed at home all
day. Indeed, the weather&mdash;sleety, rainy, stormy&mdash;forms no tempting
prospect. Bogie, too, who sees his flourish going to wreck, is looking
as spiteful as an angry fiend towards the unpropitious heavens. So I
made a day of work of it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And yet the end was not.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>April</i> 29.&mdash;This morning I finished and sent off three pages more, and
still there is something to write; but I will take the broad axe to it,
and have it ended before noon.</p>

<p>This has proved impossible, and the task lasted me till nine, when it
was finished, <i>tant bien que mal</i>. Now, will people say this expresses
very little respect for the public? In fact, I have very little respect
for that dear <i>publicum</i> whom I am doomed to amuse, like Goody Trash in
<i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, with rattles and gingerbread; and I should deal very
uncandidly with those who may read my confessions were I to say I knew a
public worth caring for or capable of distinguishing the nicer beauties
of composition. They weigh good and evil qualities by the pound. Get a
good name and you may write trash. Get a bad one and you may write like
Homer, without pleasing a single reader. I am, perhaps, <i>l'enfant g&acirc;t&eacute;
de succ&eacute;s</i>, but I am brought to the stake,<a name="FNanchor_305_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_306"><sup>[305]</sup></a> and must perforce stand
the course.</p>

<p>Having finished <i>Anne</i><a name="FNanchor_306_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_307"><sup>[306]</sup></a> I began and revised fifteen leaves <a name="Page_277"></a>of the
History, and sent them to Dr. Lardner. I think they read more trashy
than I expected. But when could I ever please myself, even when I have
most pleased others? Then I walked about two hours by the thicket and
river-side, watching the appearance of spring, which, as Coleridge
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Comes slowly up this way.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After dinner and tea I resumed the task of correction, which is an
odious one, but must be attempted, ay, and accomplished too. P/</p>

<p><i>April</i> 30.&mdash;Dr. Johnson enjoins Bozzy to leave out of his diary all
notices of the weather as insignificant. It may be so to an inhabitant
of Bolt Court, in Fleet Street, who need care little whether it rains or
snows, except the shilling which it may cost him for a Jarvie; but when
I wake and find a snow shower sweeping along, and destroying hundreds
perhaps of young lambs, and famishing their mothers, I must consider it
as worth noting. For my own poor share, I am as indifferent as any Grub
Streeter of them all&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;&mdash;And since 'tis a bad day,<br /></span>
<span>Rise up, rise up, my merry men,<br /></span>
<span>And use it as you may.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have accordingly been busy. The weather did not permit me to go beyond
the courtyard, for it continued cold and rainy. I have employed the day
in correcting the history for Cyclop&aelig;dia as far as page 35, exclusive,
and have sent it off, or shall to-morrow. I wish I knew how it would run
out. Dr. Lardner's measure is a large one, but so much the better. I
like to have ample verge and space enough, and a mere abridgment would
be discreditable. Well, nobody can say I eat the bread of idleness. Why
should I? Those who do not work from necessity take violent labour from
choice, and were necessity out of the question I would take the same
sort of literary labour from choice&mdash;something more leisurely though.</p><a name="Page_278"></a>





<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="MAY_1829"></a><h2>MAY.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>May</i> 1.&mdash;Weather more tolerable. I commenced my review on the Duke of
Guise's Expedition,<a name="FNanchor_307_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_308"><sup>[307]</sup></a> for my poor correspondent Gillies, with six
leaves. What a curious tale that is of Masaniello! I went to Huntly Burn
in the sociable, and returned on foot, to my great refreshment. Evening
as usual. Ate, drank, smoked, and wrote.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 2.&mdash;A pitiful day of rain and wind. Laboured the whole morning at
Gillies's review. It is a fine subject&mdash;the Duke of Guise at Naples&mdash;and
I think not very much known, though the story of Masaniello is.</p>

<p>I have a letter from Dr. Lardner proposing to me to publish the history
in June. But I dare not undertake it in so short a space, proof-sheets
and all considered; it must be October&mdash;no help for it.<a name="FNanchor_308_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_309"><sup>[308]</sup></a> Worked
after dinner as usual.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 3.&mdash;The very same diary might serve this day as the last. I sent
off to Gillies half his review, and I wish the other half at Old Nick.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 4.&mdash;A poor young woman came here this morning, well-dressed and
well-behaved, with a strong northern accent. She talked incoherently a
long story of a brother and a lover both dead. I would have kept her
here till I wrote to her friends, particularly to Mr. Sutherland (an
Aberdeen bookseller), to inform them where she is, but my <a name="Page_279"></a>daughter and
her maidens were frightened, as indeed there might be room for it, and
so I sent her in one of Davidson's chaises to the Castle at Jedburgh,
and wrote to Mr. Shortreed to see she is humanely treated. I have
written also to her brother.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Long shall I see these things forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And long again their sorrows feel.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The rest was write, walk, eat, smoke; smoke, and write again.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 5.&mdash;A moist rainy day, mild, however, and promising good weather.
I sat at my desk the whole day, and worked at Gillies's review. So was
the day exhausted.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 6.&mdash;I sent off the review. Received the sheets of the Secret
Tribunal from Master Reynolds. Keith Scott, a grandson of James Scott,
my father's cousin-german, came here, a fine lively boy with good
spirits and amiable manners. Just when I had sent off the rest of
Gillies's manuscript, W. Laidlaw came, so I had him for my companion in
a walk which the late weather has prevented for one or two days. Colonel
and Mrs. Ferguson, and Margaret Ferguson, came to dinner, and so passed
the evening.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 7.&mdash;Captain Percy, brother of Lord Lovaine, and son of Lord
Beverley, came out to dinner. Dr. and Mrs. Brewster met him. He is like
his brother, Lord Lovaine, an amiable, easy, and accomplished man, who
has seen a great deal of service, and roamed about with tribes of
Western Indians.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 8.&mdash;Went up Yarrow with Captain Percy, which made a complete day's
idleness, for which I have little apology to offer. I heard at the same
time from the President<a name="FNanchor_309_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_310"><sup>[309]</sup></a> that Sir Robert Dundas is very unwell, so I
must be in Edinburgh on Monday 11th. Very disagreeable, now the weather
is becoming pleasant.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 9.&mdash;Captain Percy left us at one o'clock. He has <a name="Page_280"></a>a sense of
humour, and aptness of comprehension which renders him an agreeable
companion. I am sorry his visit has made me a little idle, but there is
no help for it.</p>

<p>I have done everything to-day previous to my going away, but&mdash;<i>que
faut-il faire</i>? one must see society now and then, and this is really an
agreeable man. And so, <i>transeat ille</i>. I walked, and was so fatigued as
to sleep, and now I will attack John Lockhart's proof-sheets, of which
he has sent me a revise. In the evening I corrected proofs for the
review.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 10.&mdash;This must be a day of preparation, which I hate; yet it is
but laying aside a few books, and arranging a few papers, and yet my
nerves are fluttered, and I make blunders, and mislay my pen and my
keys, and make more confusion than I can repair. After all, I will try
for once to do it steadily.</p>

<p>Well! I have toiled through it; it is like a ground swell in the sea
that brings up all that is disgusting from the bottom&mdash;admonitory
letters&mdash;unpaid bills&mdash;few of these, thank my stars!&mdash;all that one would
wish to forget perks itself up in your face at a thorough redding
up&mdash;devil take it, I will get out and cool the fever that this turmoil
has made in my veins! The delightful spring weather conjured down the
evil spirit. I sat a long time with my nerves shaking like a frightened
child, and then laughed at it all by the side of the river, coming back
by the thicket.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 11, [<i>Edinburgh</i>].&mdash;We passed the morning in the little
arrangements previous to our departure, and then returned at night to
Edinburgh, bringing Keith Scott along. This boy's grandfather, James
Scott by name, very clever and particularly well acquainted with Indian
customs and manners. He was one of the first settlers in Prince of Wales
Island. He was an active-minded man, and therefore wrote a great deal. I
have seen a trunkful of his MSS. Unhappily, instead of writing upon some
subject on which he might have conveyed information he took to writing
on metaphysics, and <a name="Page_281"></a>lost both his candles and his labour. I was
consulted about publishing some part of his works; but could not
recommend it. They were shallow essays, with a good deal of infidelity
exhibited. Yet James Scott was a very clever man. He only fell into the
common mistake of supposing that arguments new to him were new to all
others. His son, when I knew him long since in this country, was an
ordinary man enough. This boy seems smart and clever. We reached the
house in the evening; it was comfortable enough considering it had been
shut up for two months. I found a letter from Cadell asserting his
continued hope in the success of the <i>Magnum</i>. I begin to be jealous on
the subject, but I will know to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 12.&mdash;Went to Parliament House. Sir Robert Dundas very unwell. Poor
Hamilton on his back with the gout. So was obliged to have the
assistance of Rolland<a name="FNanchor_310_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_311"><sup>[310]</sup></a> from the Second Division. Saw Cadell on the
way home. I was right: he had been disappointed in his expectations from
Glasgow and other mercantile places where trade is low at present. But</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Tidings did he bring of Africa and golden joys.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>Magnum</i> has taken extremely in Ireland, which was little counted
on, and elsewhere. Hence he proposes a new edition of <i>Tales of my
Grandfather</i>, First Series; also an enlargement of the Third Series. All
this drives poverty and pinch, which is so like poverty, from the door.</p>

<p>I visited Lady J.S., and had the pleasure to find her well. I wrote a
little, and got over a place that bothered me. Cadell has apprehensions
of <i>A</i>[<i>nne</i>] <i>of G</i>[<i>eierstein</i>], so have I. Well, the worst of it is,
we must do something better.<a name="FNanchor_311_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_312"><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="Page_282"></a><i>May</i> 13.&mdash;Attended the Court, which took up a good deal of time. On my
return saw Sir Robert Dundas, who is better&mdash;and expects to be out on
Tuesday. I went to the Highland Society to present Miss Grahame
Stirling's book, being a translation of Gelieu's work on bees,<a name="FNanchor_312_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_313"><sup>[312]</sup></a>
which was well received. Went with the girls to dine at Dalhousie
Castle, where we were very kindly received. I saw the Edgewell
Tree,<a name="FNanchor_313_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_314"><sup>[313]</sup></a> too fatal, says Allan Ramsay, to the family from which he was
himself descended. I also saw the fatal Coalston Pear,<a name="FNanchor_314_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_315"><sup>[314]</sup></a> said to have
been preserved many hundred years. It is certainly a pear either
petrified or turned into wood, with a bit out of one side of it.</p>

<p>It is a pity to see my old school-companion, this fine <a name="Page_283"></a>true-hearted
nobleman of such an ancient and noble descent, after having followed the
British flag through all quarters of the world, again obliged to resume
his wanderings at a time of life equal, I suppose, to my own. He has
not, however, a grey hair in his head.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 14.&mdash;Left Dalhousie at eight to return here to breakfast, where we
received cold tidings. Walter has had an inflammatory attack, and I fear
it will be necessary to him to return without delay to the Continent. I
have letters from Sophia and Sir Andrew Halliday. The last has been of
the utmost service, by bleeding and advising active measures. How little
one knows to whom they are to be obliged! I wrote to him and to Jane,
recommending the Ionian Islands, where Sir Frederick Adam would, I am
sure, give Walter a post on his staff. The kind old Chief Commissioner
at once interested himself in the matter. It makes me inexpressibly
anxious, yet I have kept up my determination not to let the chances of
fate overcome me like a summer's-cloud.<a name="FNanchor_315_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_316"><sup>[315]</sup></a> I wrote four or five pages
of the History to-day, notwithstanding the agitation of my feelings.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 15.&mdash;Attended the Court, where Mr. Rolland and I had the duty of
the First Division; Sir Robert and Hamilton being both laid up. Dined at
Granton and met Lord and Lady Dalhousie, Sir John Hope, etc. I have
spelled out some work this day, though I have been rather knocked about.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 16.&mdash;After the Court this day I went to vote at the Archers' Hall,
where some of the members had become restive. They were outvoted two to
one. There had been no division in the Royal Body Guard since its
commencement, but these times make divisions everywhere. A letter from
Lockhart brings better news of Walter, but my heart is heavy on the
subject. I went on with my History, how<a name="Page_284"></a>ever, for the point in this
world is to do what we ought, and bear what we must.</p>

<p>Dined at home and wrote in the evening.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 17.&mdash;I never stirred from my seat all this day. My reflections, as
suggested by Walter's illness, were highly uncomfortable; and to divert
it I wrought the whole day, save when I was obliged to stop and lean my
head on my hand. Real affliction, however, has something in it by which
it is sanctified. It is a weight which, however oppressive, may like a
bar of iron be conveniently disposed on the sufferer's person. But the
insubstantiality of a hypochondriac affection is one of its greatest
torments. You have a huge featherbed on your shoulders, which rather
encumbers and oppresses you than calls forth strength and exertion to
bear it. There is something like madness in that opinion, and yet it has
a touch of reality. Heaven help me!</p>

<p><i>May</i> 18.&mdash;I resolved to take exercise to-day, so only wrought till
twelve. I sent off some sheets and copy to Dr. Lardner. I find my
written page goes as better than one to two of his print, so a little
more than one hundred and ninety of my writing will make up the sum
wanted. I sent him off as far as page sixty-two. Went to Mr. Colvin
Smith's at one, and sat for my picture to three. There must be an end of
this sitting. It devours my time.</p>

<p>I wrote in the evening to Walter, James MacCulloch, to Dr. Lardner, and
others, and settled some other correspondence.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 19.&mdash;I went to the Court, and abode there till about one, and in
the Library from one to two, when I was forced to attend a public
meeting about the King's statue. I have no turn for these committees,
and yet I get always jamm'd into them. They take up a cruel deal of time
in a way very unsatisfactory. Dined at home, and wrought hard. I shall
be through the Bruce's reign. It is lengthy; but, <a name="Page_285"></a>hang it, it was our
only halcyon period. I shall be soon done with one-half of the thousand
pound's worth.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 20.&mdash;Mr. Cadell breakfasted with us, with a youngster for whom he
wants a letter to the Commander or Governor of Bombay. After breakfast
C. and I had some talk of business. His tidings, like those of ancient
Pistol, are of Africa and golden joys. He is sure of selling at the
starting 8000 copies of the <i>Magnum</i>, at a profit of &pound;70 per 1000&mdash;that
is, per month. This seems certain. But he thinks the sale will rise to
12,000, which will be &pound;280 more, or &pound;840 in all. This will tell out a
gross divisible profit of upwards of &pound;25,000. This is not unlikely, but
after this comes a series of twenty volumes at least, which produce only
half that quantity indeed; but then the whole profits, save commissions,
are the author's. That will come to as much as the former, say &pound;50,000
in all. This supposes I carry on the works of fiction for two or three
novels more. But besides all this, Cadell entertains a plan of selling a
cheaper edition by numbers and numbermen, on which he gives half the
selling price. One man, Mr. Ireland, offers to take 10,000 copies of the
<i>Magnum</i> and talks of 25,000. This allows a profit of &pound;50 per thousand
copies, not much worse than the larger copy, and Cadell thinks to carry
on both. I doubt this. I have great apprehension that these interlopers
would disgust the regular trade, with whom we are already deeply
engaged. I also foresee selling the worst copies at the higher price.
All this must be thought and cared for. In the meantime, I see a fund,
from which large payments may be made to the Trustees, capable of
extinguishing the debt, large as it is, in ten years or earlier, and
leaving a reversion to my family of the copyrights. Sweet
bodements<a name="FNanchor_316_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_317"><sup>[316]</sup></a>&mdash;good&mdash;but we must not reckon our chickens before they
are hatched, though they are chipping the shell now. We will see how the
stream takes.</p>
<a name="Page_286"></a>
<p>Dined at a public dinner given to the excellent Lord Dalhousie before
his departure for India. An odd way of testifying respect to public
characters, by eating, drinking, and roaring. The names, however, will
make a good show in the papers. Home at ten. Good news from Sophia and
Walter. I am zealous for the Mediterranean when the season comes, which
may be the beginning of September.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 21.&mdash;This is only the 23d on which I write, yet I have forgotten
anything that has passed on the 21st worthy of note. I wrote a good
deal, I know, and dined at home. The step of time is noiseless as it
passes over an old man. The <i>non est tanti</i> mingles itself with
everything.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 22.&mdash;I was detained long in the Court, though Ham. had returned to
his labour. We dined with Captain Basil Hall, and met a Mr. Codman, or
some such name, with his lady from Boston. The last a pleasant and
well-mannered woman, the husband Bostonian enough. We had Sir William
Arbuthnot, besides, and his lady.</p>

<p>By-the-bye, I should have remembered that I called on my old friend,
Lady Charlotte Campbell, and found her in her usual good-humour, though
miffed a little&mdash;I suspect at the history of Gillespie Grumach in the
<i>Legend of Montrose</i>. I saw Haining also, looking thin and pale. These
should have gone to the memorandum of yesterday.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 23.&mdash;Went to-day to call on the Commissioner,<a name="FNanchor_317_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_318"><sup>[317]</sup></a> and saw, at his
Grace's Levee, the celebrated divine, <i>soi-disant</i> prophet, Irving.<a name="FNanchor_318_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_319"><sup>[318]</sup></a>
He is a fine-looking man (bating a diabolical squint), with talent on
his brow and madness in his eye. His dress, and the arrangement of his
hair, indicated that much attention had been bestowed on his externals,
<a name="Page_287"></a>and led me to suspect a degree of self-conceit, consistent both with
genius and insanity.</p>

<p>Came home by Cadell's, who persists in his visions of El Dorado. He
insists that I will probably bring &pound;60,000 within six years to rub off
all Constable's debts, which that sum will do with a vengeance. Cadell
talks of offering for the Poetry to Longman. I fear they will not listen
to him. The <i>Napoleon</i> he can command when he likes by purchasing their
stock in hand. The Lives of the Novelists may also be had. Pleasant
schemes all these, but dangerous to build upon. Yet in looking at the
powerful machine which we have put in motion, it must be owned &quot;as
broken ships have come to land.&quot;</p>

<p>Waited on the Commissioner at five o'clock, and had the pleasure to
remain till eight, when the debate in the Assembly was over. The
question which employed their eloquence was whether the celebrated Mr.
Irving could sit there as a ruling elder.<a name="FNanchor_319_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_320"><sup>[319]</sup></a> It was settled, I think
justly, that a divine, being of a different order of officers in the
Kirk, cannot assume the character of a ruling elder, seeing he cannot
discharge its duties.</p>

<p>Mr. Irving dined with us. I could hardly keep my eyes off him while we
were at table. He put me in mind of the devil disguised as an angel of
light, so ill did that horrible obliquity of vision harmonise with the
dark tranquil features of his face, resembling that of our Saviour in
Italian pictures, with the hair carefully arranged in the same manner.
There was much real or affected simplicity in the manner in which he
spoke. He rather <i>made play</i>, and spoke much across the table to the
Solicitor, and seemed to be good-humoured. But he spoke with that kind
of unction which is nearly [allied] to cajolerie. He boasted much of the
tens of thousands that attended his ministry at the town of Annan, <a name="Page_288"></a>his
native place, till he wellnigh provoked me to say he was a distinguished
exception to the rule that a prophet was not esteemed in his own
country. But time and place were not fitting.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 24.&mdash;I wrote or <i>wrought</i> all the morning, yea, even to
dinner-time. Miss Kerr, and Mrs. Skene, and Will Clerk dined. Skene came
from the Commissioner's at seven o'clock. We had a merry evening. Clerk
exults in the miscarriage of the Bill for the augmentation of the
judges' salaries. He and the other clerks in the Jury Court had hoped to
have had a share in the proposed measure, but the Court had considered
it as being <i>nos poma natamus</i>. I kept our friends quiet by declining to
move in a matter which was to expose us to the insult of a certain
refusal. Clerk, with his usual felicity of quotation, said they should
have remembered the Clown's exhortation to Lear, &quot;Good nuncle, tarry and
take the fool with you.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_320_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_321"><sup>[320]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>May</i> 25.&mdash;Wrote in the morning. Dr. Macintosh Mackay came to breakfast,
and brought with him, to show me, the Young Chevalier's target, purse,
and snuff-box, the property of Cluny MacPherson. The pistols are for
holsters, and no way remarkable; a good serviceable pair of weapons
silver mounted. The targe is very handsome indeed, studded with
ornaments of silver, chiefly emblematic, chosen with much taste of
device and happily executed. There is a contrast betwixt the shield and
purse, the targe being large and heavy, the purse, though very handsome,
unusually small and light. After one o'clock I saw the Duke and Duchess
of Gordon; then went to Mr. Smith's to finish a painting for the last
time. The Duchess called with a Swiss lady, to introduce me to her
friend, while I was doing penance. I was heartily glad to see her Grace
once more. Called in at Cadell's. His orders continue so thick that he
must postpone the delivery for several days, to get new <a name="Page_289"></a>engravings
thrown off, etc. <i>Vogue la gal&egrave;re!</i> From all that now appears, I shall
be much better off in two or three years than if my misfortunes had
never taken place. <i>Periissem ni periissem.</i></p>

<p>Dined at a dinner given by the Antiquarian Society to Mr. Hay Drummond,
Secretary to the Society, now going Consul to Tangiers. It was an
excellent dinner&mdash;turtle, champagne, and all the <i>agr&eacute;mens</i> of a capital
meal, for &pound;1, 6s. a-head. How Barry managed I can't say. The object of
this compliment spoke and drank wine incessantly; good-naturedly
delighted with the compliment, which he repeatedly assured me he valued
more than a hundred pounds. I take it that after my departure, which was
early, it would be necessary to &quot;carry Mr. Silence to bed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_321_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_322"><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>May</i> 26.&mdash;The business at the Court heavy. Dined at Gala's, and had the
pleasure to see him in amended health. Sir John and Lady Hope were
there, and the evening was lively and pleasant. George Square is always
a melancholy place for me. I was dining next door to my father's former
house.<a name="FNanchor_322_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_323"><sup>[322]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>May</i> 27.&mdash;I got up the additional notes for the <i>Waverley Novels</i>. They
seem to be setting sail with a favourable wind. I had to-day a most kind
and friendly letter from the Duke of Wellington, which is a thing to be
vain of. He is a most wonderful man to have climbed to such a height
without ever slipping his foot. Who would have said in 1815 that the
Duke would stand still higher in 1829, and yet it indubitably is so. We
dined with Lady Charlotte Campbell, now Lady Charlotte Bury, and her
husband, who is an egregious fop but a fine draughtsman. Here is another
day gone without work in the evening.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 28.&mdash;The Court as usual till one o'clock. But I forgot to say Mr.
Macintosh Mackay breakfasted, and in<a name="Page_290"></a>spected my curious Irish MS., which
Dr. Brinkley gave me.<a name="FNanchor_323_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_324"><sup>[323]</sup></a> Mr. Mackay, I should say Doctor, who well
deserved the name, reads it with tolerable ease, so I hope to knock the
marrow out of the bone with his assistance. I came home and despatched
proof-sheets and revises for Dr. Lardner. I saw kind John Gibson, and
made him happy with the fair prospects of the <i>Magnum</i>. He quite agrees
in my views. A young clergyman, named M'Combie, from Aberdeenshire, also
called to-day. I have had some consideration about the renewal or
re-translation of the Psalmody. I had peculiar views adverse to such an
undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_324_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_325"><sup>[324]</sup></a> In the first place, it would be highly unpopular with
the lower and more ignorant rank, many of whom have no idea of the
change which those spiritual poems have suffered in translation, but
consider their old translations as the very songs which David composed.
At any rate, the lower class think that our fathers were holier and
better men than we, and that to abandon their old hymns of devotion, in
order to grace them with newer and more modish expression, would be a
kind of sacrilege. Even the best informed, who think on the subject,
must be of opinion that even the somewhat bald and rude language and
versification of the Psalmody gives them an antique and venerable air,
and their want of the popular graces of modish poetry shows they belong
to a style where ornaments are not required. They contain, besides, the
very words which were spoken and sung by the fathers of the Reformation,
sometimes in the wilderness, sometimes in fetters, sometimes at the
stake. If a Church possessed the <a name="Page_291"></a>vessels out of which the original
Reformers partook of the Eucharist, it would be surely bad taste to melt
them down and exchange them for more modern. No, no. Let them write
hymns and paraphrases if they will, but let us have still</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;All people that on earth do dwell.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_325_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_326"><sup>[325]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Law and devotion must lose some of their dignity as often as they adopt
new fashions.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 30.&mdash;The Skenes came in to supper last night. Dr. Scott of Haslar
Hospital came to breakfast. He is a nephew of Scott of Scalloway, who is
one of the largest proprietors in Shetland. I have an agreeable
recollection of the kindness and hospitality of these remote isles, and
of this gentleman's connections in particular, who welcomed me both as a
stranger and a Scott, being duly tenacious of their clan. This young
gentleman is high in the medical department of the navy. He tells me
that the Ultima Thule is improving rapidly. The old clumsy plough is
laid aside. They have built several stout sloops to go to the deep-sea
fishing, instead of going thither in open boats, which consumed so much
time between the shore and the haaf or fishing spot. Pity but they would
use a steam-boat to tow them out! I have a real wish to hear of
Zetland's advantage. I often think of its long isles, its towering
precipices, its capes covered with sea-fowl of every class and
description that <a name="Page_292"></a>ornithology can find names for, its deep caves, its
smoked geese, and its sour sillocks. I would like to see it again. After
the Court I came round by Cadell, who is like Jemmy Taylor,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Full of mirth and full of glee,&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>for which he has good reason, having raised the impression of the
<i>Magnum</i> to 12,000 copies, and yet the end is not, for the only puzzle
now is how to satisfy the delivery fast enough.<a name="FNanchor_326_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_327"><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>May</i> 31.&mdash;We dined at Craigcrook with Jeffrey. It is a most beautiful
place, tastefully planted with shrubs and trees, and so sequestered,
that after turning into the little avenue, all symptoms of the town are
left behind you. He positively gives up the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.<a name="FNanchor_327_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_328"><sup>[327]</sup></a> A
very pleasant evening. Rather a glass of wine too much, for I was heated
during the night. Very good news of Walter.</p>
<a name="Page_293"></a>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="JUNE_1829"></a><h2>JUNE.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>June</i> 1.&mdash;Being Sunday I remained to work the whole day, and finished
half of the proposed volume of History. I was not disturbed the whole
day, a thing rather unusual.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 2.&mdash;Received Mr. Rees of London and Col. Ferguson to breakfast.
Mr. Rees is clearly of opinion our scheme (the <i>Magnum</i>) must
answer.<a name="FNanchor_328_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_329"><sup>[328]</sup></a> I got to letter-writing after breakfast, and cleared off
old scores in some degree. Dr. Ross called and would hardly hear of my
going out. I was obliged, however, to attend the meeting of the trustees
for the Theatre.<a name="FNanchor_329_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_330"><sup>[329]</sup></a> The question to be decided was, whether we should
embrace an option left to us of taking the old Theatre at a valuation,
or whether we should leave it to Mrs. Siddons and Mr. Murray to make the
best of it. There were present Sir Patrick Murray, Baron Hume, Lord
Provost, Sir John Hay, Mr. Gilbert Innes, and myself. We were all of
opinion that personally we ought to have nothing to do with it. But I
thought as trustees for the public, we were bound to let the public know
how the matter stood, and that they might, if they pleased, have the
theatrical property for &pound;16,000, which is dog cheap. They were all clear
to give it up (the right of reversion) to Mrs. Siddons. I am glad she
should have it, for she is an excellent person, and so is her brother.
But I think it has <a name="Page_294"></a>been a little jobbish. There is a clause providing
the new patentees may redeem. I desired that the circumstance should be
noted, that we were only exercising our own judgment, leaving the future
trustees to exercise theirs. I rather insisted that there should be some
saving clause of this kind, even for the sake of our honour. But I could
not prevail upon my colleagues to put such a saving clause on the
minutes, though they agreed to the possibility of the new patentees
redeeming on behalf of the public. I do not think we have done right.</p>

<p>I called on Mr. Cadell, whose reports of the <i>Magnum</i> might fill up the
dreams of Alnaschar should he sleep as long as the seven sleepers. The
rest was labour and letters till bed-time.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 3.&mdash;The ugly symptoms still continue. Dr. Ross does not make much
of it, and I think he is apt to look grave.<a name="FNanchor_330_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_331"><sup>[330]</sup></a> I wrote in the morning.
Dr. Macintosh Mackay came to breakfast, and brought a Gaelic book, which
he has published&mdash;the Poetry of Rob Donn&mdash;some of which seems pretty as
he explained it. Court kept me till near two, and then home comes I.
Afternoon and evening was spent as usual. In the evening Dr. Ross
ordered me to be cupped, an operation which I only knew from its being
practised by that eminent medical practitioner the barber of Bagdad. It
is not painful; and, I think, resembles a giant twisting about your
flesh between his finger and thumb.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 4.&mdash;I was obliged to absent myself from the Court on Dr. Ross's
positive instance; and, what is worse, I was compelled to send an
apology to Hopetoun House, where I expected to see Madame Caradori, who
was to sing Jock of <a name="Page_295"></a>Hazeldean. I wrote the song for Sophia; and I find

</div></div>

<p>I worked at the <i>Tales of my Grandfather</i>, but leisurely.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 5.&mdash;Cadell came to dine with me <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,</i> for the girls are
gone to Hopetoun House. We had ample matter to converse upon, for his
horn was full of good news. While we were at dinner we had letters from
London and Ireland, which decided him to raise the impression of
<i>Waverley</i> to 15,000. This, with 10,000 on the number line which Ireland
is willing to take, will make &pound;18,000 a year of divisible profit. This
leads to a further speculation, as I said, of great importance. Longman
&amp; Co. have agreed to sell their stock on hand of the Poetry, in which
they have certain shares, their shares included, for &pound;8000. Cadell
thinks he could, by selling off at cheap rates, sorting, making waste,
etc., get rid of the stock for about &pound;5000, leaving &pound;3000 for the
purchase of the copyrights, and proposes to close the bargain as much
cheaper as he can, but at all events to close it. Whatever shall fall
short of the price returned by the stock, the sale of which shall be
entirely at his risk, shall be reckoned as the price of the copyright,
and we shall pay half of that balance. I had no hesitation in
authorising him to proceed in his bargain with Owen Rees of Longman's
house upon that principle. For supposing, according to Cadell's present
idea, the loss on the stock shall amount to &pound;2000 or &pound;3000, the
possession of the entire copyright undivided would enable us,
calculating upon similar success to that of the Novels, to make at least
&pound;500 per cent. Longman &amp; Co. have indeed an excellent bargain, but then
so will we. We pay dear indeed for what the ostensible subject of sale
is, but if it sets free almost the whole of our <a name="Page_296"></a>copyrights, and places
them in our own hands, we get a most valuable <i>quid pro quo</i>. There is
only one-fourth, I think, of <i>Marmion</i> in Mr. Murray's hands, and it
must be the deuce if that cannot be [secured].<a name="FNanchor_331_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_332"><sup>[331]</sup></a> Mr. Cadell proposed
that, as he took the whole books on his risk, he ought to have
compensation, and that it should consist in the sum to be given to me
for arranging and making additions to the volumes of Poetry thus to be
republished. I objected to this, for in the first place he may suffer no
loss, for the books may go off more rapidly than he thinks or expects.
In the second place, I do not know what my labours in the Poetry may be.
In either case it is a blind bargain; but if he should be a sufferer
beyond the clear half of the loss, which we agree to share with him, I
agreed to make him some compensation, and he is willing to take what I
shall think just; so stands our bargain. Remained at home and wrote
about four pages of <i>Tales</i>. I should have done more, but my head, as
Squire Sullen says, &quot;aiked consumedly.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_332_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_333"><sup>[332]</sup></a> Rees has given Cadell a
written offer to be binding till the twelfth; meantime I have written to
Lockhart to ask John Murray if he will treat for the fourth share of
<i>Marmion</i>, which he possesses. It can be worth but little to him, and
gives us all the copyrights. I have a letter from Sir Thomas Dick
Lauder, touching a manuscript of Messrs. Hay Allan called the
<i>Vestiarium Scoti&aelig;</i> by a Sir Richard Forrester. If it is an imposition
it is cleverly done, but I doubt the quarter it comes from. These Hay
Allans are men of warm imaginations. It makes the strange averment that
all the Low-Country gentlemen and border clans wore tartan, and gives
sets of them all. I must see the manuscript before I believe in it. The
Allans are singular men, of much accomplishment but little probity&mdash;that
is, in antiquarian matters. Cadell lent me &pound;10,&mdash;funny enough, after all
our grand expectations, for Croesus to want such a gratility!</p>
<a name="Page_297"></a>
<p><i>June</i> 7.&mdash;I rose at seven, and wrote to Sir Thomas Lauder a long
warning on the subject of these Allans and their manuscript.<a name="FNanchor_333_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_334"><sup>[333]</sup></a>
Proceeded to write, but found myself pulled up by the necessity of
reading a little. This occupied my whole morning. The Lord President
called very kindly <a name="Page_298"></a>to desire me to keep at home to-morrow. I thought of
being out, but it may be as well not. I am somehow or other either
listless or lazy. My head aches cruelly. I made a fight at reading and
working till eleven, and then came sleep with a party-coloured [mantle]
of fantastic hues, and wrapt me into an imaginary world.</p>

<p><i>June</i>, 8.&mdash;I wrote the whole morning till two o'clock. Then I went into
the gardens of Princes Street, to my great exhilaration. I never felt
better for a walk; also it is the first I have taken this whole week and
more. I visited some remote garden grounds, where I had not been since I
walked there with the good Samaritan Skene, sadly enough, at the <a name="Page_299"></a>time
of my misfortunes.<a name="FNanchor_334_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_335"><sup>[334]</sup></a> The shrubs and young trees, which were then
invisible, are now of good size, and gay with leaf and blossom. I, too,
old trunk as I am, have put out tender buds of hope, which seemed
checked for ever.</p>

<p>I may now look with fair hope to freeing myself of obligation from all
men, and spending the rest of my life in ease and quiet. God make me
thankful for so cheering a prospect!</p>

<p><i>June</i> 9.&mdash;I wrote in the morning, set out for a walk at twelve o'clock
as far as Mr. Cadell's. I found him hesitating about his views, and
undecided about the Number plan. He thinks the first plan answers so
much beyond expectation it is a pity to interfere with it, and talks of
re-engraving the plates. This would be touchy, but nothing is resolved
on.</p>

<p>Anne had a little party, where Lady Charlotte Bury, Lady Hopetoun, and
others met the Caradori, who sung to us very kindly. She sung Jock of
Hazeldean very well, and with a peculiar expression of humour. Sandie
Ballantyne kindly came and helped us with fiddle and flageolet. Willie
Clerk was also here. We had a lunch, and were very gay, <a name="Page_300"></a>not the less so
for the want of Mr. Bury, who is a thorough-paced coxcomb, with some
accomplishments, however. I drank two glasses of champagne, which have
muddled my brains for the day. Will Clerk promised to come back and dine
on the wreck of the turkey and tongue, pigeon-pie, etc. He came,
accordingly, and stayed till nine; so no time for work. It was not a
lost day, however.<a name="FNanchor_335_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_336"><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>June</i> 10.&mdash;<i>Nota bene</i>, my complaint quite gone. I at<a name="Page_301"></a>tended the Court,
and sat there till late. Evening had its lot of labour, which is, I
think, a second nature to me. It is astonishing how little I look into a
book of entertainment. I have been reading over the <i>Five Nights of St.
Albans</i>,&mdash;very much <i>extra m&#339;nia nostri mundi</i>, and possessed of
considerable merit, though the author<a name="FNanchor_336_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_337"><sup>[336]</sup></a> loves to play at cherry-pit
with Satan.<a name="FNanchor_337_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_338"><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>June</i> 11.&mdash;I was kept at Court by a hearing till near three. Then sat
to Mr. Graham for an hour and a half. When I came home, behold a letter
from Mr. Murray, very handsomely yielding up the fourth share of
<i>Marmion</i>, which he possessed.<a name="FNanchor_338_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_339"><sup>[338]</sup></a> Afterwards we went to the theatre,
where St. Ronan's Well was capitally acted by Murray and the Bailie,&mdash;the
part of Clara Mowbray being heavy for want of Mrs. Siddons. Poor old
Mrs. Renaud, once the celebrated Mrs. Powell, took leave of the stage.
As I was going to bed at twelve at night, in came R.P.Gillies like a
tobacco cask. I shook him off with some difficulty, pleading my having
been lately ill, but he is to call to-morrow morning.</p>
<br />

<p><i>June</i> 12.&mdash;Gillies made his appearance. I told him frankly I thought he
conducted his affairs too irregularly for any one to assist him, and I
could not in charity advise any one to encourage subscriptions, but that
I should subscribe myself, so I made over to him about &pound;50, which the
<i>Foreign Review</i> owes me, and I will grow hard-hearted and do no more. I
was not long in the Court, but I had to look at the controversy about
the descent of the Douglas family, then I went to Cadell and found him
still cock-a-hoop. He has raised the edition to 17,000, a monstrous
number, yet he thinks it will clear the 20,000, but we must be quiet in
case people jalouse the failure of the plates. I called on Lady
J.S.<a name="FNanchor_339_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_340"><sup>[339]</sup></a> When I came home I was sleepy and over-<a name="Page_302"></a>walked. By the way, I
sat till Graham finished my picture.<a name="FNanchor_340_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_341"><sup>[340]</sup></a> I fell fast asleep before
dinner, and slept for an hour. After dinner I wrote to Walter, Charles,
Lockhart, and John Murray, and took a screed of my novel; so concluded
the evening idly enough.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 13.&mdash;We hear of Sophia's motions. She is to set sail by
steam-boat on the 16th, Tuesday, and Charles is to make a run down with
her. But, alas! my poor Johnnie is, I fear, come to lay his bones in his
native land. Sophia can no longer disguise it from herself, that as his
strength weakens the disease increases. The poor child is so much bent
on coming to see Abbotsford and grandpapa, that it would be cruel not to
comply with his wish&mdash;and if affliction comes, we will bear it best
together.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Not more the schoolboy who expires<br /></span>
<span>Far from his native home desires<br /></span>
<span>To see some friend's familiar face,<br /></span>
<span>Or meet a parent's last embrace.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It must be all as God wills it. Perhaps his native air may be of
service.</p>

<p>More news from Cadell. He deems it necessary to carry up the edition to
20,000.</p>

<p>[<i>Abbotsford.</i>]&mdash;This day was fixed for a start to Abbotsford, where we
arrived about six o'clock, evening. To my thinking, I never saw a
prettier place; and even the trees and flowers seemed to say to me, We
are your own again. But I must not let imagination jade me thus. It
would be to make disappointment doubly bitter: and, God knows, I have in
my child's family matter enough to check any exuberant joy.</p>

<p><i>June 14</i>.&mdash;A delicious day&mdash;threatening rain; but with the languid and
affecting manner in which beauty demands sympathy when about to weep. I
wandered about the banks and braes all morning, and got home about
three, <a name="Page_303"></a>and saw everything in tolerable order, excepting that there was
a good number of branches left in the walks. There is a great number of
trees cut, and bark collected. Colonel Ferguson dined with us, and spent
the afternoon.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 15.&mdash;Another charming day. Up and despatched packets for
Ballantyne and Cadell; neither of them was furiously to the purpose, but
I had a humour to be alert. I walked over to Huntly Burn, and round by
Chiefswood and Janeswood, where I saw Captain Hamilton. He is busy
finishing his Peninsular campaigns.<a name="FNanchor_341_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_342"><sup>[341]</sup></a> He will not be cut out by
Napier, whose work has a strong party cast; and being, besides, purely
abstract and professional, to the public seems very dull. I read General
Miller's account of the South American War.<a name="FNanchor_342_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_343"><sup>[342]</sup></a> I liked it the better
that Basil Hall brought the author to breakfast with me in Edinburgh. A
fine, tall, military figure, his left hand withered like the prophet's
gourd, and plenty of scars on him. There have been rare doings in that
vast continent; but the strife is too distant, the country too unknown,
to have the effect upon the imagination which European wars produce.</p>

<p>This evening I indulged in the <i>far niente</i>&mdash;a rare event with me, but
which I enjoy proportionally.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 16.&mdash;Made up parcel for Dr. Lardner; and now I propose to set
forth my memoranda of Byron for Moore's acceptance, which ought in
civility to have been done long since.<a name="FNanchor_343_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_344"><sup>[343]</sup></a> I will have a walk, however,
in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="Page_304"></a>I did not get on with Byron so far as I expected&mdash;began it though, and
that is always something. I went to see the woods at Huntly Burn, and
Mars Lea, etc. Met Captain Hamilton, who tells me a shocking thing. Two
Messrs. Stirling of Drumpellier came here and dined one day, and seemed
spirited young men. The younger is murdered by pirates. An Indian vessel
in which he sailed was boarded by these miscreants, who behaved most
brutally; and he, offering resistance I suppose, was shockingly mangled
and flung into the sea. He was afterwards taken up alive, but died soon
after. Such horrid accidents lie in wait for those <a name="Page_305"></a>whom we see &quot;all
joyous and unthinking,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_344_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_345"><sup>[344]</sup></a> sweeping along the course of life; and what
end may be waiting ourselves? Who can tell?</p>

<p><i>June</i> 17.&mdash;Must take my leave of sweet Abbotsford, and my leisure hour,
my eve of repose. To go to town will take up the morning.</p>

<p><i>[Edinburgh.]</i>&mdash;We set out about eleven o'clock, got to Edinburgh about
four, where I dined with Baron Clerk and a few Exchequer friends&mdash;Lord
Chief Baron, Sir Patrick Murray, Sir Henry Jardine, etc. etc.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 18.&mdash;Corrected proofs for Dr. Dionysius Lardner. Cadell came to
breakfast. Poor fellow, he looks like one who had been overworked; and
the difficulty of keeping paper-makers up to printers, printers up to
draughtsmen, artists to engravers, and the whole party to time, requires
the utmost exertion. He has actually ordered new plates, although the
steel ones which we employ are supposed to throw off 30,000 without
injury. But I doubt something of this. Well, since they will buckle
fortune on our back we must bear it scholarly and wisely.<a name="FNanchor_345_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_346"><sup>[345]</sup></a> I went to
Court. Called on my return on J.B. and Cadell. At home I set to correct
<i>Ivanhoe</i>. I had twenty other things more pressing; but, after all,
these novels deserve a preference. Poor Terry is totally prostrated by a
paralytic affection. Continuance of existence not to be wished for.</p>

<p>To-morrow I expect Sophia and her family by steam.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 19.&mdash;Sophia, and Charles who acted as her escort, arrived at nine
o'clock morning, fresh from the steamboat. They were in excellent
health&mdash;also the little boy and girl; but poor Johnnie seems very much
changed indeed, and I should not be surprised if the scene shortly
closes. There is obviously a great alteration in strength and features.
At dinner we had our family chat on a scale that I had not enjoyed for
many years. The Skenes supped with us.</p>

<p><a name="Page_306"></a><i>June</i> 20.&mdash;Corrected proof-sheets in the morning for Dr. Lardner. Then
I had the duty of the Court to perform.</p>

<p>As I came home I recommended young Shortreed to Mr. Cadell for a
printing job now and then when Ballantyne is over-loaded, which Mr.
Cadell promised accordingly.</p>

<p>Lady Anna Maria Elliot's company at dinner. Helped on our family party,
and passed the evening pleasantly enough, my anxiety considering.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 21.&mdash;A very wet Sunday. I employed it to good purpose, bestowing
much labour on the History, ten pages of which are now finished. Were it
not for the precarious health of poor Johnnie I would be most happy in
this reunion with my family, but, poor child, this is a terrible
drawback.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 22.&mdash;I keep working, though interruptedly. But the heat in the
midst of the day makes me flag and grow irresistibly drowsy. Mr. and
Mrs. Skene came to supper this evening. Skene has engaged himself in
drawing illustrations to be etched by himself for <i>Waverley</i>. I wish it
may do.<a name="FNanchor_346_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_347"><sup>[346]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_307"></a>
<p><i>June</i> 23.&mdash;I was detained in the Court till half-past [three]. Captain
William Lockhart dined with Skene. The Captain's kind nature had brought
him to Edinburgh to meet his sister-in-law.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 24.&mdash;I was detained late in the Court, but still had time to go
with Adam Wilson and call upon a gentlemanlike East Indian officer,
called Colonel Francklin, who appears an intelligent and respectable
man. He writes the History of Captain Thomas,<a name="FNanchor_347_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_349"><sup>[347]</sup></a> a person of the
condition of a common seaman, who raised himself to the rank of a native
prince, and for some time waged a successful war with the powers around
him. The work must be entertaining.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 25.&mdash;Finished correcting proofs for Tales, 3d Series. The Court
was over soon, but I was much exhausted. On the return home quite sleepy
and past work. I looked in on Cadell, whose hand is in his housewife's
cap, driving and pushing to get all the works forward in due order, and
cursing the delays of artists and engravers. I own I wish we had not
hampered ourselves with such causes of delay.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 26.&mdash;Mr. Ellis, missionary from the South Sea Islands,
breakfasted, introduced by Mr. Fletcher, minister of the parish of
Stepney.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis's account of the progress of civilisation, as connected with
religion, is very interesting. Knowledge of every kind is
diffused&mdash;reading, writing, printing, abundantly common. Polygamy
abolished. Idolatry is put down; the priests, won over by the chiefs,
dividing among them <a name="Page_308"></a>the consecrated lands which belonged to their
temples. Great part of the population are still without religion, but
willing to be instructed. Wars are become infrequent; and there is in
each state a sort of representative body, or senate, who are a check on
the despotism of the chief. All this has come hand in hand with
religion. Mr. Ellis tells me that the missionaries of different sects
avoided carefully letting the natives know that there were points of
disunion between them. Not so some Jesuits who had lately arrived, and
who taught their own ritual as the only true one. Mr. Ellis described
their poetry to me, and gave some examples; it had an Ossianic
character, and was composed of metaphor. He gave me a small collection
of hymns printed in the islands. If this gentleman is sincere, which I
have no doubt of, he is an illustrious character. He was just about to
return to the Friendly Islands, having come here for his wife's health.</p>

<p>[<i>Blairadam.</i>]&mdash;After the Court we set off (the two Thomsons and I) for
Blair-Adam, where we held our Macduff Club for the twelfth anniversary.
We met the Chief Baron, Lord Sydney Osborne, Will Clerk, the merry
knight Sir Adam Ferguson, with our venerable host the Lord Chief
Commissioner, and merry men were we.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 27.&mdash;I ought not, where merry men convene, to omit our jovial son
of Neptune, Admiral Adam. The morning proving delightful, we set out for
the object of the day, which was Falkland. We passed through Lochore,
but without stopping, and saw on the road eastward, two or three places,
as Balbedie, Strathendry, and some others known to me by name. Also we
went through the town of Leslie, and saw what remains of the celebrated
rendezvous of rustic gallantry called Christ's Kirk on the Green.<a name="FNanchor_348_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_350"><sup>[348]</sup></a>
It is now cut up with houses, one of the most hideous of which is a new
church, having the very worst <a name="Page_309"></a>and most offensive kind of Venetian
windows. This, I am told, has replaced a quiet lowly little Gothic
building, coeval, perhaps, with the royal poet who celebrated the spot.
Next we went to Falkland, where we found Mr. Howden, factor of Mr.
Tyndall Bruce, waiting to show us the palace.</p>

<p>Falkland has most interesting remains. A double entrance-tower, and a
side building running east from it, is roofed, and in some degree
habitable; a corresponding building running northward from the eastern
corner is totally ruinous, having been destroyed by fire. The
architecture is highly ornamented, in the style of the Palace at
Stirling. Niches with statues, with projections, cornices, etc, are
lavished throughout. Many cornice medallions exhibited such heads as
those procured from the King's room at Stirling, the originals, perhaps,
being the same. The repeated cypher of James V. and Mary of Guise attest
the builder of this part of the palace. When complete it had been a
quadrangle. There is as much of it as remained when Slezer published his
drawings. Some part of the interior has been made what is called
habitable, that is, a half-dozen of bad rooms have been gotten out of
it. Am clear in my own mind a ruin should be protected, but never
repaired. The proprietor has a beautiful place called Nut-hill, within
ten minutes' walk of Falkland, and commanding some fine views of it and
of the Lomond Hill. This should be the residence. But Mr. Bruce and his
predecessor, my old professor, John Bruce,<a name="FNanchor_349_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_351"><sup>[349]</sup></a> deserve great credit for
their attention to prevent dilapidation, which was doing its work fast
upon the ancient palace. The only remarkable apartment was a large and
well-proportioned gallery with a painted roof&mdash;<i>tempore Jacobi
Sexti</i>&mdash;and built after his succession to the throne of England. I
noticed a curious thing,&mdash;a hollow column concealed the rope which rung
the Castle bell, keeping it safe from injury and interruption.</p>
<a name="Page_310"></a>
<p>The town of Falkland is old, with very narrow streets. The arrival of
two carriages and a gig was an event important enough to turn out the
whole population. They are said to be less industrious, more dissipated,
and readier to become soldiers than their neighbours. So long a court
retains its influence!</p>

<p>We dined at Wellfield with my Mend George Cheape, with whom I rode in
the cavalry some thirty years ago. Much mirth and good wine made us
return in capital tune. The Chief Baron and Admiral Adam did not go on
this trip. When we returned it was time to go to bed by a candle.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 28.&mdash;Being Sunday, we lounged about in the neighbourhood of the
crags called Kiery Craigs, etc. The Sheriff-substitute of Kinross came
to dinner, and brought a gold signet<a name="FNanchor_350_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_352"><sup>[350]</sup></a> which had been found in that
town. It was very neat work, about the size of a shilling. It bore in a
shield the arms of Scotland and England, <i>parti per pale</i>, those of
Scotland occupying the dexter side. The shield is of the heater or
triangular shape. There is no crown nor legend of any kind; a slip of
gold folds upwards on the back of the hinge, and makes the handle neatly
enough. It is too well wrought for David II.'s time, and James IV. is
the only monarch of the Scottish line who, marrying a daughter of
England, may carry the arms of both countries <i>parti per pale.</i> Mr.
Skelton is the name of the present possessor.</p>

<p><a name="Page_311"></a>Two reported discoveries. One, that the blaeberry shrub contains the
tanning quality as four to one compared to the oak&mdash;which may be of
great importance, as it grows so commonly on our moors.</p>

<p>The other, that the cutting of an apple-tree, or other fruit-tree, may
be preserved by sticking it into a potato and planting both together.
Curious, if true.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 29 <i>[Edinburgh].</i>&mdash;We dined together at Blair-Adam, having walked
in the woods in the morning, and seen a beautiful new walk made through
the woody hill behind the house. In a fine evening, after an early
dinner, our party returned to Edinburgh, and there each dispersed to his
several home and resting-place. I had the pleasure of finding my family
all well, except Johnnie.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 30.&mdash;After my short sniff of country air, here am I again at the
receipt of custom. The sale with Longman &amp; Co., for stock and copyrights
of my [Poetical] Works, is completed, for &pound;7000, at dates from twelve to
thirty-six months. There are many sets out of which we may be able to
clear the money, and then we shall make something to clear the
copyright. I am sure this may be done, and that the bargain will prove a
good one in the long run.</p>

<p>Dined at home with my family, whom, as they disperse to-morrow, I have
dedicated the evening to.</p><a name="Page_312"></a>

<a name="JULY_1829"></a><h2>JULY.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>July</i> 1.&mdash;This morning wrote letters and sent them off by Charles. It
was Teind Wednesday, so I was at home to witness the departure of my
family, which was depressing. My two daughters, with the poor boy
Johnnie, went off at ten o'clock, my son Charles, with my niece, about
twelve. The house, filled with a little bustle attendant on such a
removal, then became silent as the grave. The voices of the children,
which had lately been so clamorous with their joyous shouts, are now
hushed and still. A blank of this kind is somewhat depressing, and I
find it impossible to resume my general tone of spirits. A lethargy has
crept on me which no efforts can dispel; and as the day is rainy, I
cannot take exercise. I have read therefore the whole morning, and have
endeavoured to collect ideas instead of expending them. I have not been
very successful. In short, <i>diem perdidi</i>.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 2.&mdash;I made up for my deficiencies yesterday, and besides
attending the Court wrote five close pages, which I think is very near
double task. I was alone the whole day and without interruption. I have
little doubt I will make my solitude tell upon my labours, especially
since they promise to prove so efficient. I was so languid yesterday
that I did not record that J. Ballantyne, his brother Sandy, <a name="Page_313"></a>and Mr.
Cadell dined here on a beef-steak, and smoked a cigar, and took a view
of our El Dorado.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 3.&mdash;Laboured at Court, where I was kept late, and wrought on my
return home, finishing about five pages. I had the great pleasure to
learn that the party with the infantry got safe to Abbotsford.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 4.&mdash;After Court I came home and set to work, still on the
<i>Tales</i>. When I had finished my bit of dinner, and was in a quiet way
smoking my cigar over a glass of negus, Adam Ferguson comes with a
summons to attend him to the Justice-Clerk's, where, it seems, I was
engaged. I was totally out of case to attend his summons, redolent as I
was of tobacco. But I am vexed at the circumstance. It looks careless,
and, what is worse, affected; and the Justice is an old friend
moreover.<a name="FNanchor_351_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_353"><sup>[351]</sup></a> I rather think I have been guilty towards him in this
respect before. Devil take my stupidity! I will call on Monday and say,
Here is my sabre and here is my heart.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 5.&mdash;Sir Adam came to breakfast, and with him Mr. and Mrs.
Johnstone of Bordeaux, the lady his cousin. I could not give them a
right Scottish breakfast, being on a Sunday morning. Laboured on the
<i>Tales</i> the whole morning.</p>

<p>The post brought two letters of unequal importance. One from a person
calling himself Haval, announcing to me the terrific circumstance that
he had written against the Waverley Novels in a publication called <i>La
Belle Assembl&eacute;e</i>, at which doubtless, he supposes, I must be much
annoyed. He be d&mdash;&mdash;, and that's plain speaking. The other from Lord
Aberdeen, announcing that Lockhart, Dr. Gooch, and myself, are invested
with the power of examining the papers of the Cardinal Duke of York, and
reporting what is fit for publication. This makes it plain that the
Invisible<a name="FNanchor_352_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_354"><sup>[352]</sup></a> neither slumbers nor sleeps. The toil and remuneration
must be <a name="Page_314"></a>Lockhart's, and to any person understanding that sort of work
the degree of trust reposed holds out hope of advantage. At any rate, it
is a most honourable trust, and I have written in suitable terms to Lord
Aberdeen to express my acceptance of it, adverting to my necessary
occupations here, and expressing my willingness to visit London
occasionally to superintend the progress of the work. Treated myself,
being considerably fagged, with a glass of poor Glengarry's
super-excellent whisky and a cigar, made up my Journal, wrote to the
girls, and so to roost upon a crust of bread and a glass of small beer,
my usual supper.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 6.&mdash;I laboured all the morning without anything unusual, save a
call from my cousin, Mary Scott of Jedburgh, whom I persuaded to take
part of my chaise to Abbotsford on Saturday. At two o'clock I walked to
Cadell's, and afterwards to a committee of the Bannatyne Club.
Thereafter I went to Leith, where we had fixed a meeting of <i>The Club</i>,
now of forty-one years' standing.<a name="FNanchor_353_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_355"><sup>[353]</sup></a> I was in the chair, and Sir Adam
croupier. We had the Justice-Clerk, Lord Abercromby, Lord Pitmilly, Lord
Advocate, James Ferguson, John Irving, and William Clerk, and passed a
merry day for old fellows. It is a curious thing that only <i>three</i> have
died of this club since its formation. These were the Earl of Selkirk;
James Clerk, Lieutenant in the Navy; and Archibald Miller, W.S. Sir
Patrick Murray was an unwilling absentee. There were absent&mdash;Professor
Davidson of Glasgow, besides Glassford, who has cut our society, and
poor James Edmonstoune, whose state of health precludes his ever joining
society again. We took a fair but moderate allowance of wine, sung our
old songs, and were much refreshed with a hundred old stories, which
would have seemed insignificant to any stranger. The most important of
these were old college adventures of love and battle.</p>
<a name="Page_315"></a>
<p><i>July</i> 7.&mdash;I was rather apprehensive that I might have felt my unusual
dissipation this morning, but not a whit; I rose as cool as a cucumber,
and set about to my work till breakfast-time. I am to dine with
Ballantyne to-day. To-morrow with John Murray. This sounds sadly like
idleness, except what may be done either in the morning before
breakfast, or in the broken portion of the day between attendance on the
Court and my dinner meal,&mdash;a vile, drowsy, yawning, fagged portion of
existence, which resembles one's day, as a portion of the shirt,
escaping betwixt one's waistcoat and breeches, indicates his linen.</p>

<p>Dined with James Ballantyne, who gave us a very pleasant party. There
was a great musician, Mr. Neukomm, a German, a pupil of Haydn, a
sensible, pleasant man.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 8.&mdash;This morning I had an ample dose of proofs and could do
nothing but read them. The Court kept me till two; I was then half
tempted to go to hear Mr. Neukomm perform on the organ, which is said to
be a most masterly exhibition, but I reflected how much time I should
lose by giving way to temptation, and how little such ears as mine would
be benefited by the exhibition, and so I resolved to return to my
proofs, having not a little to do. I was so unlucky as to meet my
foreigner along with Mr. Laine, the French Consul, and his lady, who all
invited me to go with them, but I pleaded business, and was set down,
doubtless, for a Goth, as I deserved. However, I got my proofs settled
before dinner-time, and began to pack up books, etc.</p>

<p>I dined at John Murray's, and met, amongst others, Mr. Schutze, the
brother-in-law of poor George Ellis. We conversed about our mutual
friend, and about the life Canning was to have written about him, and
which he would have done <i>con amore</i>. He gave me two instances of poor
George's neatness of expression, and acuteness of discrimination. Having
met, for the first time, &quot;one Perceval, a young lawyer,&quot; he records him
as a person who, with the advantages <a name="Page_316"></a>of life and opportunity, would
assuredly rise to the head of affairs. Another gentleman is briefly
characterised as &quot;a man of few words, and fewer ideas.&quot; Schutze himself
is a clever man, with something dry in his manner, owing, perhaps, to an
imperfection of hearing. Murray's parties are always agreeable and well
chosen.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 9.&mdash;I began an immense arrangement of my papers, but was obliged
to desist by the approach of four o'clock. Having been enabled to shirk
the Court, I had the whole day to do what I wished, and as I made some
progress I hope I will be strengthened to resume the task when at
Abbotsford.</p>

<p>Heard of the death of poor Bob Shortreed,<a name="FNanchor_354_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_356"><sup>[354]</sup></a> the companion of many a
long ride among the hills in quest of old ballads. He was a merry
companion, a good singer and mimic, and full of Scottish drollery. In
his company, and under his guidance, I was able to see much of rural
society in the mountains which I could not otherwise have attained, and
which I have made my use of. He was, in addition, a man of worth and
character. I always burdened his hospitality while at Jedburgh on the
Circuit, and have been useful to some of his family. Poor fellow! He
died at a most interesting period for his family, when his eldest
daughter was about to make an advantageous marriage. So glide our
friends from us&mdash;<i>Haec poena diu viventibus</i>. Many recollections die
with him and with poor Terry.<a name="FNanchor_355_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_357"><sup>[355]</sup></a> I dined with the Skenes in a family
way.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 10,&mdash;Had a hard day's work at the Court till about <a name="Page_317"></a>two, and then
came home to prepare for the country. I made a <i>talis qualis</i>
arrangement of my papers, which I trust I shall be able to complete at
Abbotsford, for it will do much good. I wish I had a smart boy like Red
Robin the tinker. Wrote also a pack of letters.</p>

<p><i>Abbotsford, July</i> 11.&mdash;I was detained in the Court till nearly one
o'clock, then set out and reached Abbotsford in five or six hours. Found
all well, and Johnnie rather better. He sleeps, by virtue of being in
the open air, a good deal.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 12.&mdash;The day excessively rainy, or, as we call it, soft. I e'en
unpacked my books and did a great deal to put them in order, but I was
sick of the labour by two o'clock and left several of my books and all
of my papers at sixes and sevens. Sir Adam and the Colonel dined with
us. A Spanish gentleman with his wife, whom I had seen at the French
Consul's, also dropped in. He was a handsome, intelligent, and sensible
man; his name I have forgot. We had a pleasant evening.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 13.&mdash;This day I wrote till one, resuming the History, and making
out a day's task. Then went to Chiefswood, and had the pleasure of a
long walk with a lady, well known in the world of poetry, Mrs. Hemans.
She is young and pretty, though the mother of five children, as she
tells me. There is taste and spirit in her conversation. My daughters
are critical, and call her blue, but I think they are hypercritical. I
will know better when we meet again. I was home at four. Had an evening
walk with little Walter, who held me by the finger, gabbling eternally
much that I did, and more that I did not, understand. Then I had a long
letter to write to Lockhart,<a name="FNanchor_356_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_358"><sup>[356]</sup></a> correct and read, and despatch proofs,
etc.; and to bed heartily tired, though with no great exertion.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 14.&mdash;A rainy forenoon broke the promise of a delightful morning.
I wrote four and a half pages, to make the best of a bad bargain. If I
can double the daily task, <a name="Page_318"></a>I will be something in hand. But I am
resolved to stick to my three pages a day at least. The twelfth of
August will then complete my labours.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 15.&mdash;This day two very pretty and well-bred boys came over to
breakfast with us. I finished my task of three pages and better, and
went to walk with the little fellows round the farm, by the lake, etc.,
etc. They were very good companions. Tom has been busy thinning the
terrace this day or two, and is to go on.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 16.&mdash;I made out my task-work and betook myself to walk about
twelve. I feel the pen turn heavy after breakfast; perhaps my solemn
morning meal is too much for my intellectual powers, but I won't abridge
a single crumb for all that. I eat very little at dinner, and can't
abide to be confined in my hearty breakfast. The work goes on as
task-work must, slow, sure, and I trust not drowsy, though the author
is. I sent off to Dionysius Lardner (Goodness be with us, what a name!)
as far as page thirty-eight inclusive, but I will wait to add
to-morrow's quota. I had a long walk with Tom.<a name="FNanchor_357_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_359"><sup>[357]</sup></a> I am walking with
more pleasure <a name="Page_319"></a>and comfort to myself than I have done for many a day.
May Heaven continue this great mercy, which I have so much reason to be
thankful for!</p>

<p><i>July</i> 17.&mdash;- We called at Chiefswood and asked Captain Hamilton, and
Mrs. H., and Mrs. Hemans, to dinner on Monday. She is a clever person,
and has been pretty. I had a long walk with her <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. She told
me of the peculiar melancholy attached to the words <i>no more</i>. I could
not help telling, as a different application of the words, how an old
dame riding home along Cockenzie Sands, pretty bowsy, fell off the
pillion, and her husband, being in good order also, did not miss her
till he came to Prestonpans. He instantly returned with some neighbours,
and found the good woman seated amidst the advancing tide, which began
to rise, with her lips ejaculating to her cummers, who she supposed were
still pressing her to another cup, &quot;Nae ae drap mair, I thank you
kindly.&quot; We dined in family, and all well.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 18.&mdash;- A Sunday with alternate showers and sunshine. Wrote double
task, which brings me to page forty-six inclusive. I read the
<i>Spae-wife</i> of Galt. There is something good in it, and the language is
occasionally very forcible, but he has made his story difficult to
understand, by adopting a region of history little known, and having
many heroes of the same name, whom it is not easy to keep separate in
one's memory. Some of the traits of the <i>Spae-wife</i>, who conceits
herself to be a changeling or twin, are <a name="Page_320"></a>very good indeed. His Highland
Chief is a kind of Caliban, and speaks, like Caliban, a jargon never
spoken on earth, but full of effect for all that.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 19.&mdash;I finished two leaves this morning, and received the
Hamiltons and Mrs. Hemans to breakfast. Afterwards we drove to Yarrow
and showed Mrs. Hemans the lions. The party dined with us, and stayed
till evening. Of course no more work.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 20.&mdash;A rainy day, and I am very drowsy and would give the world
to &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_358_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_360"><sup>[358]</sup></a>. [**Note: dash is a blank space] I wrote four leaves,
however, and then my understanding dropped me. I have made up for
yesterday's short task.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<blockquote><p>NOTE.&mdash;From July 20th, 1329, to May 23d, 1830, there are no entries
     in the Journal, but during that time Sir Walter met with a sad
     loss. He was deprived of his humble friend and staunch henchman,
     Thomas Purdie. The following little note to Laidlaw shows how
     keenly he felt his death:&mdash;</p>

<p>     &quot;MY DEAR WILLIE,&mdash;I write to tell you the shocking news of poor Tom
     Purdie's death, by which I have been greatly affected. He had
     complained, or rather spoken, of a sore throat; and the day before
     yesterday, as it came on a shower of rain, I wanted him to walk
     fast on to Abbotsford before me, but you know well how impossible
     that was. He took some jelly, or trifle of that kind, but made no
     complaint. This morning he rose from bed as usual, and sat down by
     the table with his head on his hand; and when his daughter spoke to
     him, life had passed away without a sigh or groan. Poor fellow!
     There is a heart cold that loved me well, and, I am sure, thought
     of my interest more than his own. I have seldom been so much
     shocked. I wish you would take a ride down and pass the night.
     There is much I have to say, and this loss adds to my wish to see
     you. We dine at four. The day is indifferent, but the sooner the
     better.&mdash;Yours very truly,</p>

<p>     &quot;WALTER SCOTT.<a name="FNanchor_359_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_361"><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p>     &quot;<i>31st</i> (sic) <i>October</i>,&quot; Qy. <i>29th</i>.</p>

<p>     <a name="Page_321"></a>To Mr. Cadell, a few days later, he says, &quot;I have lost my old and
     faithful servant, my <i>factotum</i>, and am so much shocked that I
     really wish to be quit of the country. I have this day laid him in
     the grave.&quot;</p>

<p>     On coming to Edinburgh, Sir Walter found that his old friend and
     neighbour Lady Jane Stuart<a name="FNanchor_360_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_362"><sup>[360]</sup></a> was no longer there to welcome him.
     She also had died somewhat suddenly on October 28th, and was buried
     at Invermay on November 4th.</p></blockquote>

<br />

<p><i>May</i> 23, [<i>Abbotsford.</i>]&mdash;About a year ago I took the pet at my Diary,
chiefly because I thought it made me abominably selfish; and that by
recording my gloomy fits I encouraged their recurrence, whereas out of
sight, out of mind, is the best way to get rid of them; and now I hardly
know why I take it up again; but here goes. I came here to attend
Raeburn's funeral. I am near of his kin, my great-grandfather, Walter
Scott, being the second son or first cadet of this small family. My late
kinsman was also married to my aunt, a most amiable old lady. He was
never kind to me, and at last utterly ungracious. Of course I never
liked him, and we kept no terms. He had forgot, though, an infantine
cause of quarrel, which I always remembered. When I was four or five
years old I was staying at Lessudden House, an old mansion, the abode of
this Raeburn. A large pigeon-house was almost destroyed with starlings,
then a common bird, though now seldom seen. They were seized in their
nests and put in a bag, and I think drowned, or threshed to death, or
put to some such end. The servants gave one to me, which I in some
degree tamed, and the brute of a laird seized and wrung its neck. I flew
at his throat like a wild cat, and was torn from him with no little
difficulty. Long afterwards I did him the mortal offence to recall some
superiority which my father had lent to the laird to make up a
qualification, which he meant to exercise by voting for Lord Minto's
interest against poor Don. This made a total breach between two
relations who had never been friends, and though I was <a name="Page_326"></a>afterwards of
considerable service to his family, he kept his ill-humour, alleging
justly enough that I did these kind actions for the sake of his wife and
family, not for his benefit. I now saw him at the age of eighty-two or
three deposited in the ancestral grave. Dined with my cousins, and
returned to Abbotsford about eight o'clock.</p>

<p><i>May 24, [Edinburgh].</i>&mdash;Called on my neighbour Nicol Milne of
Faldonside, to settle something about the road to Selkirk. Afterwards
went to Huntly Burn and made my compliments to the family. Lunched at
half-past two and drove to town, calling at George Square on Gala. He
proposed to give up the present road to Selkirk in favour of another on
the north side of the river, to be completed by two bridges. This is an
object for Abbotsford. In the evening came to town. Letter from Mr.
H[aydon] soliciting &pound;20. Wait till Lockhart comes.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 25.&mdash;Got into the old mill this morning, and grind away. Walked in
very bad day to George Square from the Parliament House, through paths
once familiar, but not trod for twenty years. Met Scott of Woll and
Scott of Gala, and consulted about the new road between Galashiels and
Selkirk. I am in hopes to rid myself of the road to Selkirk, which goes
too near me at Abbotsford. Dined at Lord Chief Commissioner's, where we
met the new Chief Baron Abercromby<a name="FNanchor_361_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_363"><sup>[361]</sup></a> and his lady. I thought it was
the first time we had met for above forty years, but he put me in mind
we had dined one day at John Richardson's.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 26.&mdash;Wrought with proofs, etc., at the <i>Demonology</i>, which is a
cursed business to do neatly. I must finish it <a name="Page_327"></a>though, for I need
money. I went to the Court; from that came home, and scrambled on with
half writing, half reading, half idleness till evening. I have laid
aside smoking much; and now, unless tempted by company, rarely take a
cigar. I was frightened by a species of fit which I had in February,
which took from me my power of speaking. I am told it is from the
stomach. It looked woundy like palsy or apoplexy. Well, be it what it
will, I can stand it.<a name="FNanchor_362_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_364"><sup>[362]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>May</i> 27.&mdash;Court as usual. I am agitating a proposed <a name="Page_328"></a>retirement from
the Court. As they are only to have four instead of six Clerks of
Session in Scotland, it will be their interest to let me retire on a
superannuation. Probably I shall make a bad bargain, and get only
two-thirds of the salary, instead of three-fourths. This would be hard,
but I could save between two and three hundred pounds by giving up town
residence; and surely I could do enough with my time at reviews and
other ways, so as to make myself comfortable at Abbotsford. At any rate,
<i>jacta est aha</i>; Sir Robert Peel and the Advocate seem to acquiesce in
the arrangement, and Sir Robert Dundas retires alongst with me. I think
the difference will be infinite in point of health and happiness.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 28.&mdash;Wrought in the morning, then the Court, then Cadell's. My
affairs go on up to calculation, and the <i>Magnum</i> keeps its ground. If
this can last for five or six years longer we may clear our hands of
debt; but perhaps I shall have paid that of Nature before that time
come. They will have the books, and Cadell to manage them, who is a
faithful pilot. The poetry which we purchased for [&pound;7000], payable in
two years, is melting off our hands; and we will feed our <i>Magnum</i> in
that way when we have sold the present stock, by which we hope to pay
the purchase-money, and so go on velvet with the continuation. So my
general affairs look well. I expect Lockhart and Sophia to arrive this
evening in the Roads, and breakfast with us to-morrow. This is very
reviving.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 29.&mdash;The Lockharts were to appear at nine o'clock, but it is past
four, and they come not. There has been easterly wind, and a swell of
the sea at the mouth of the Firth, but nevertheless I wish they would
come. The machinery is liable to accidents, and they may be delayed
thus.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper, the great contractor for the mail coaches, one of the
sharpest men in his line, called here to-day to give <a name="Page_329"></a>his consent to our
line of road. He pays me the compliment of saying he wishes my views on
the subject. That is perhaps fudge, but at least I know enough to choose
the line that is most for my own advantage. I have written to make Gala
acquainted that my subscription depends on their taking the Gala foot
road; no other would suit me. After dinner I began to tease myself about
the children and their parents, and night went down on our uncertainty.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 30.&mdash;Our travellers appeared early in the morning, <i>cum tota
sequela</i>. Right happy were we all. Poor Johnnie looks well. His
deformity is confirmed, poor fellow; but he may be a clever lad for all
that. An imposthume in his neck seems to be the crisis of his complaint.
He is a gentle, placid creature. Walter is remarkably handsome, and so
is little Whippety Stourie,<a name="FNanchor_363_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_365"><sup>[363]</sup></a> as I call her. After breakfast I had a
chat with Lockhart about affairs in general, which, as far as our little
interests are concerned, are doing very well. Lockhart is now
established in his reputation and literary prospects.<a name="FNanchor_364_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_366"><sup>[364]</sup></a> I wrote some
more in his <i>Demonology</i>, which is a scrape, I think.</p>

<p><a name="Page_330"></a><i>May</i> 31.&mdash;Set to work early, and did a good day's work without much
puffing and blowing. Had Lockhart at dinner, and a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> over
our cigar. He has got the right ideas for getting to the very head of
the literary world and now stands very high as well for taste and
judgment as for genius. I think there is no fear now of his letting a
love of fun run away with him. At home the whole day, except a walk to
Cadell's, who is enlarging his sale. As he comes upon heavy months, and
is come now to the <i>Abbot</i>, the <i>Monastery</i>, and the less profitable or
popular of the novels, this is a fortunate circumstance. The management
seems very judicious.</p><a name="Page_331"></a>





<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="JUNE_1830"></a><h2>JUNE.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>June</i>, 1.&mdash;Proofs and Court, the inevitable employment of the day.
Louisa Kerr dined with us, and Williams looked in. We talked a good deal
on Celtic witchery and fairy lore. I was glad to renew my acquaintance
with this able and learned man.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 2.&mdash;The Lockharts left us again this morning, and although three
masons are clanking at their work to clear a well, the noise is
mitigated, now the poor babies' clang of tongues is removed. I set
myself to write, determining to avoid reasoning, and to bring in as many
stories as possible. Being a Teind Wednesday, I may work undisturbed,
and I will try to get so far ahead as may permit a journey to Abbotsford
on Saturday. At nine o'clock was as far ahead as page 57. It runs out
well, and 150 pages will do.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 3.&mdash;Finished my proofs, and sent them off with copy. I saw Mr.
Dickinson<a name="FNanchor_365_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_367"><sup>[365]</sup></a> on Tuesday: a right plain sensible man. He is so
confident in my matters, that, being a large creditor himself, he offers
to come down, with the support of all the London creditors, to carry
through any measure that can be devised for my behoof. Mr. Cadell showed
him that we are four years forward in matter prepared for the press. Got
Heath's illustrations, which, I dare say, are finely engraved, but
commonplace enough in point of art.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 4.&mdash;Court as usual, and not long detained. Visited Cadell. All
right, and his reports favourable, it being the <a name="Page_332"></a>launch of our annual
volume, now traversing a year, with unblemished reputation and success
uninterrupted. I should have said I overhauled proofs and furnished copy
in the morning between seven and ten o'clock.</p>

<p>After coming from the Court I met Woll and Gala, and agreed upon the
measures to be attempted at Selkirk on the eighth at the meeting of
trustees. In the evening smoked an extra cigar (none since Tuesday), and
dedicated the rest to putting up papers, etc., for Abbotsford. Anne
wants me to go to hear the Tyrolese Minstrels, but though no one more
esteems that bold and high-spirited people, I cannot but think their
yodelling, if this be the word, is a variation, or set of variations,
upon the tones of a jackass, so I remain to dribble and scribble at
home.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 5.&mdash;I rose at seven as usual, and, to say truth, dawdled away my
time in putting things to rights, which is a vile amusement, and writing
letters to people who write to ask my opinion of their books, which is
as much as to say&mdash;&quot;Tom, come tickle me.&quot; This is worse than the other
pastime, but either may serve for a broken day, and both must be done
sometimes.</p>

<p>[<i>Abbotsford</i>.]&mdash;After the Court, started for Abbotsford at half-past
twelve at noon, and here we are at half-past five <i>impransi</i>. The
country looks beautiful, though the foliage, larches in particular, have
had a blight. Yet they can hardly be said to lose foliage since they
have but a sort of brushes at best.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 6.&mdash;Went through a good deal of duty as to proofs, and the like.
At two set out and reached by four Chiefswood, where I had the happiness
to find the Lockharts all in high spirits, well and happy. Johnnie must
be all his life a weakly child, but he may have good health, and
possesses an admirable temper. We dined with the Lockharts, and were all
very happy.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 7.&mdash;Same duty carefully performed. I continued <a name="Page_333"></a>working till
about one, when Lockhart came to walk. We took our course round by the
Lake. I was a good deal fagged, and must have tired my companion by
walking slow. The Fergusons came over&mdash;Sir Adam in all his glory&mdash;and
&quot;the night drave on wi' sangs and clatter.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_366_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_368"><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>June</i> 8.&mdash;Had not time to do more than correct a sheet or two. About
eleven set off for Selkirk, where there was a considerable meeting of
road trustees. The consideration of the new road was intrusted to a
committee which in some measure blinks the question; yet I think it must
do in the end. I dined with the Club, young Chesters president. It is
but bad fun, but I might be father of most of them, and must have
patience. At length</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>June</i> 9.&mdash;In the morning I advised Sheriff Court processes, carried on
the <i>Demonology</i> till twelve, then put books, etc., in some order to
leave behind me. Will it be ordered that I come back not like a
stranger, or sojourner, but to inhabit here? I do not know; I shall be
happy either way. It is perhaps a violent change in the end of life to
quit the walk one has trod so long, and the cursed splenetic temper,
which besets all men, makes you value opportunities and circumstances
when one enjoys them no longer. Well! things must be as they may, as
says that great philosopher Corporal Nym.<a name="FNanchor_368_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_370"><sup>[368]</sup></a></p>

<p>[<i>Edinburgh</i>.]&mdash;I had my walk, and on my return found the Lockharts come
to take luncheon, and leave of us. Reached Edinburgh at nine o'clock.
Found, among less interesting letters, two from Lord Northampton on the
death of the poor Marchioness,<a name="FNanchor_369_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_371"><sup>[369]</sup></a> and from Anna Jane Clephane on the
same melancholy topic. <i>Hei mihi!</i></p>
<a name="Page_334"></a>
<p><i>June</i> 10.&mdash;Corrected proofs, prepared some copy, and did all that was
right. Dined and wrought in the evening, yet I did not make much way
after all.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 11.&mdash;In the morning, the usual labour of two hours. God bless
that habit of being up at seven! I could do nothing without it, but it
keeps me up to the scratch, as they say. I had a letter this morning
with deep mourning paper and seal; the mention of my nephew in the first
line made me sick, fearing it had related to Walter. It was from poor
Sir Thomas Bradford, who has lost his lady, but was indeed an account of
Walter,<a name="FNanchor_370_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_372"><sup>[370]</sup></a> and a good one.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 12.&mdash;A day of general labour and much weariness.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 13.&mdash;The same may be said of this day.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 14.&mdash;And of this, only I went out for an hour and a half to Mr.
Colvin Smith, to conclude a picture for Lord Gillies. This is a sad
relief from labour.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;... Sedet &aelig;ternumque sedebit<br /></span>
<span>Infelix Theseus.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_371_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_373"><sup>[371]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Lord Gillies has been so kind and civil that I must have his picture
as like as possible.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 15.&mdash;I had at breakfast the son of Mr. Fellenburg<a name="FNanchor_372_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_374"><sup>[372]</sup></a> of
Hofwyll, Switzerland, a modest young man. I used to think his father
something of a quack, in proposing to discover how a boy's natural
genius lies, with a view to his education. How would they have made me a
scholar, is a curious question. Whatever was forced on me as a task I
should have detested. There was also a gentlemanlike little man, the
Chevalier de&mdash;&mdash;, silent, and speaks no English. Poor George Scott,
Harden, is dead of the typhus fever. Poor dear boy! I am sorry for him,
and yet more for his parents. I have a letter from Henry on the subject.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 16.&mdash;I wrote this forenoon till I completed the 100 pages, which
is well done. I had a call from Colin <a name="Page_335"></a>Mackenzie, whom I had not seen
for nearly two years. He has not been so well, and looks ghastly, but I
think not worse than I have seen him of late years. We are very old
acquaintances. I remember he was one of a small party at college, that
formed ourselves into a club called the Poetical Society. The other
members were Charles Kerr of Abbotrule (a singular being), Colin
M'Laurin (insane), Colin, and I, who have luckily kept our wits. I also
saw this morning a Mr. Low, a youth of great learning, who has written a
good deal on the early history of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_373_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_375"><sup>[373]</sup></a> He is a good-looking,
frank, gentlemanlike lad; with these good gifts only a parish
schoolmaster in Aberdeenshire. Having won a fair holiday I go to see
Miss Kemble for the first time. It is two or three years since I have
been in a theatre, once my delight.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 17.&mdash;Went last night to theatre, and saw Miss Fanny Kemble's
Isabella,<a name="FNanchor_374_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_376"><sup>[374]</sup></a> which was a most creditable performance. It has much of
the genius of Mrs. Siddons, her aunt. She wants her beautiful
countenance, her fine form, and her matchless dignity of step and
manner. On the other hand, Miss Fanny Kemble has very expressive, though
not regular, features, and what is worth it all, great energy mingled
with and chastened by correct taste. I suffered by the heat, lights, and
exertion, and will not go back to-night, for it has purchased me a sore
headache this theatrical excursion. Besides, the play is Mrs.
Beverley,<a name="FNanchor_375_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_377"><sup>[375]</sup></a> and I hate to be made miserable about domestic distress,
so I keep my gracious presence at home to-night, though Ive and respect
Miss Kemble for giving her active support to her father in his need, and
preventing Covent Garden from coming down about their ears. I corrected
proofs before breakfast, attended Court, but was idle in the forenoon,
the headache annoying me much. Dinner will make me better. And so <a name="Page_336"></a>it
did. I wrote in the evening three pages, and tolerably well, though I
may say with the Emperor Titus (not Titus Oates) that I have lost a day.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 18, <i>[Blair-Adam]</i>.&mdash;Young John Colquhoun of Killermont and his
wife breakfasted with us,&mdash;a neat custom that, and saves wine and
wassail. Then to Court, and arranged for our departure for Blair-Adam,
it being near midsummer when the club meets. Anne with me, and Sir Adam
Ferguson. The day was execrable. Our meeting at Blair-Adam was cordial,
but our numbers diminished; the good and very clever Lord Chief
Baron<a name="FNanchor_376_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_378"><sup>[376]</sup></a> is returned to his own country, with more regrets than in
Scotland usually attend a stranger. Will Clerk has a bad cold, [Thomas]
Thomson is detained, but the Chief Commissioner, Admiral Adam, Sir Adam,
John Thomson and I, make an excellent concert. I only hope our venerable
host will not fatigue himself. To-morrow we go to Culross, which Sir
Robert Preston is repairing, and the wise are asking for whose future
enjoyment. He is upwards of ninety, but still may enjoy the bustle of
life.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 19.&mdash;Arose and expected to work a little, but a friend's house is
not favourable; you are sure to want the book you have not brought, and
are in short out of sorts, like the minister who could not preach out of
his own pulpit. There is something fanciful in this, and something real
too, and I have forgot my watch and left half my glasses at home.</p>

<p>Off we set at half-past eight o'clock, Lord Chief Commissioner being
left at home owing to a cold. We breakfasted at Luscar, a place
belonging to Adam Rolland, but the gout had arrested him at Edinburgh,
so we were hospitably received by his family. The weather most
unpropitious, very cold and rainy. After breakfast to Culross, where the
veteran, Sir Robert Preston,<a name="FNanchor_377_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_379"><sup>[377]</sup></a> showed us his curiosities. Life has
done as much for him as most people. In his <a name="Page_337"></a>ninety-second year he has
an ample fortune, a sound understanding, not the least decay of eyes,
ears, or taste; is as big as two men, and eats like three. Yet he too
experiences the <i>singula pr&aelig;dantur anni</i>, and has lost something since I
last saw him. If his appearance renders old age tolerable, it does not
make it desirable. But I fear when death comes we shall be unwilling for
all that to part with our bundle of sticks. Sir Robert amuses himself
with repairing the old House of Culross, built by the Lord Bruce of
Kinloss. To what use it is destined is not very evident to me. It is too
near his own comfortable mansion of Valleyfield to be useful as a
residence, if indeed it could be formed into a comfortable modern house.
But it is rather like a banqueting house. Well, he follows his own
fancy. We had a sumptuous cold dinner. Adam grieves it was not hot, so
little can war and want break a man to circumstances. We returned to
Blair-Adam in the evening, through &quot;the wind but and the rain.&quot; For June
weather it is the most ungenial I have seen. The beauty of Culross
consists in magnificent terraces rising on the sea-beach, and commanding
the opposite shore of Lothian; the house is repairing in the style of
James the Sixth. The windows have pediments like Heriot's Work.<a name="FNanchor_378_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_380"><sup>[378]</sup></a>
There are some fine relics of the old Monastery, with large Saxon
arches. At Luscar I saw with pleasure the painting by Raeburn, of my old
friend Adam Rolland, Esq.,<a name="FNanchor_379_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_381"><sup>[379]</sup></a> who was in the external circumstances,
but not in frolic or fancy, my prototype for Paul Pleydell.<a name="FNanchor_380_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_382"><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>June</i> 20.&mdash;We settled this morning to go to church at Lochore, that is,
at Ballingray; but when we came to the earthly paradise so called, we
were let off for there was no <a name="Page_338"></a>sermon, for which I could not in my heart
be sorry. So, after looking at Lochore, back we came to lounge and
loiter about till dinner-time. The rest of the day was good company,
good cheer, and good conversation. Yet to be idle here is not the thing,
and to be busy is impossible, so I wish myself home again in spite of
good entertainment. We leave to-night after an early dinner, and I will
get to work again.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 21, [<i>Edinburgh</i>].&mdash;Wrote to Walter a long letter. The day
continued dropping occasionally, but Sir Adam was in high fooling, and
we had an amazing deal of laughing. We stole a look at the Kiery Craigs
between showers. In the meantime George Cheape and his son came in. We
dined at half-past three, but it was seven ere we set off, and did not
reach the house in Shandwick Place till eleven at night. Thus ended our
Club for the year 1830, its thirteenth anniversary. Its numbers were
diminished by absence and indisposition, but its spirit was unabated.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 22.&mdash;Finished proofs and some copy in the morning. Returned at
noon, and might have laboured a good day's work, but was dull, drowsy,
and indolent, and could not, at least did not, write above half a page.
It was a day lost, and indeed it is always with me the consequence of
mental indolence for a day or two, so I had a succession of eating and
dozing, which I am ashamed of, for there was nothing to hinder me but
&quot;thick-coming fancies.&quot; Pshaw, rabbit un!</p>

<p><i>June</i> 23.&mdash;Worked well this morning, and then to Court. At two called
on Mr. Gibson, and find him disposed for an instalment. Cadell has
&pound;10,000, and Gibson thinks &pound;12,000 will pay 2s. 6d. I wish it could be
made three shillings, which would be &pound;15,000.</p>

<p>Presided at a meeting of the Bannatyne Club. The Whigs made a strong
party to admit Kennedy of Dunure, which set aside Lord Medwyn, who had
been longer on the roll of candidates. If politics get into this Club it
will ruin the literary purpose of the meeting, and the general
good-<a name="Page_339"></a>humour with which it has gone on. I think it better to take the
thing good-humouredly, and several of them volunteered to say that
Medwyn must be the next, which will finish all <i>&agrave; l'aimable</i>. If it come
to party-work I will cut and run. Confound it! my eyes are closing now,
even <i>now</i>, at half-past four.</p>

<p>Dined with Lord Medwyn, a pleasant party. The guest of importance, Mrs.
Peter Latouche from Dublin, a fine old dame, who must have been
beautiful when young, being pleasant and comely at seventy,&mdash;saintly it
appears.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 24.&mdash;Hard work with Ballantyne's proofs and revises, but got them
accomplished. I am at the twelfth hour, but I think I shall finish this
silly book before the tenth of July.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this sage resolution I did not write half a page of the
said <i>Demonology</i> this day. I went to the Court, called on Mr. Cadell,
returned dog-tired, and trifled my time with reading the trial of
Corder. What seemed most singular was his love to talk of the young
woman he had murdered, in such a manner as to insinuate the
circumstances of his own crime, which is a kind of necessity which seems
to haunt conscience-struck men. Charles Sharpe came in at night and
supped with us.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 25.&mdash;Slept little later than I should. The proofs occupied the
morning. The Court and walk home detained me till two. When I returned,
set to work and reached page 210 of copy. There is little or nothing
else to say. Skene was with me for a few minutes. I called at Cadell's
also, who thinks a dividend of 3s. per pound will be made out.<a name="FNanchor_381_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_383"><sup>[381]</sup></a> This
will be one-half of the whole debts, and leave a sinking fund for the
rest about &pound;10,000 a year &quot;if the beast live and the branks bide
hale.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_382_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_384"><sup>[382]</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="Page_340"></a><i>June</i> 26.&mdash;Miss Kemble and her father breakfasted here, with Sir Adam
and Lady Ferguson. I like the young lady very much, respecting both her
talents and the use she has made of them. She seems merry, unaffected,
and good-humoured. She said she did not like the apathy of the Scottish
audiences, who are certain not to give applause upon credit. I went to
the Court, but soon returned; a bad cold in my head makes me cough and
sneeze like the Dragon of Wantley. The Advocates' Bill<a name="FNanchor_383_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_385"><sup>[383]</sup></a> is read a
third time. I hardly know whether to wish it passed or no, and am
therefore <i>in utrumque paratus</i>.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 27.&mdash;In the morning worked as usual at proofs and copy of my
infernal <i>Demonology</i>&mdash;a task to which my poverty and not my will
consents. About twelve o'clock I went to the country to take a day's
relaxation. We (i.e. Mr. Cadell, James Ballantyne, and I) went to
Prestonpans, and, getting there about one, surveyed the little village,
where my aunt and I were lodgers for the sake of sea-bathing in 1778, I
believe. I knew the house of Mr. Warroch, where we lived,&mdash;a poor
cottage, of which the owners and their family are extinct. I recollected
my juvenile ideas of dignity attendant on the large gate, a black arch
which lets out upon the sea. I saw the church where I yawned under the
inflictions of a Dr. M'Cormick, a name in which dulness seems to have
been hereditary. I saw the Links where I arranged my shells upon the
turf, and swam my little skiffs in the pools. Many comparisons between
the man, and the recollections of my kind aunt, of old George Constable,
who, I think, dangled after her; of Dalgetty, a veteran half-pay
lieutenant, who swaggered his solitary walk on the parade, as he called
a little open space before the same pool. We went to Preston, and took
refuge from a thunder-plump in the old tower. I remembered the little
garden where I was crammed with gooseberries, and the fear I had of
Blind Harry's spectre of Fawdon showing his <a name="Page_341"></a>headless trunk at one of
the windows. I remembered also a very good-natured pretty girl (my Mary
Duff), whom I laughed and romped with and loved as children love. She
was a Miss Dalrymple, daughter of Lord Westhall,<a name="FNanchor_384_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_386"><sup>[384]</sup></a> a Lord of Session;
was afterwards married to Anderson of Winterfield, and her daughter is
now [the spouse] of my colleague Robert Hamilton. So strangely are our
cards shuffled. I was a mere child, and could feel none of the passion
which Byron alleges, yet the recollection of this good-humoured
companion of my childhood is like that of a morning dream, nor should I
now greatly like to dispel it by seeing the original, who must now be
sufficiently time-honoured.</p>

<p>Well, we walked over the field of battle, saw the Prince's Park, Cope's
Loan, marked by slaughter in his disastrous retreat, the thorn-tree
which marks the centre of the battle, and all besides that was to be
seen or supposed. We saw two broadswords, found on the field of battle,
one a Highlander's, an Andrew Ferrara, another the dragoon's sword of
that day. Lastly, we came to Cockenzie, where Mr. Francis Cadell, my
publisher's brother, gave us a kind reception. I was especially glad to
see the mother of the family, a fine old lady, who was civil to my aunt
and me, and, I recollect well, used to have us to tea at Cockenzie.
Curious that I should long afterwards have an opportunity to pay back
this attention to her son Robert. Once more, what a kind of shuffling of
the hand dealt us at our nativity. There was Mrs. F. Cadell, and one or
two young ladies, and some fine fat children. I should be a bastard to
the time<a name="FNanchor_385_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_387"><sup>[385]</sup></a> did I not tell our fare. We had a <i>tiled</i> whiting,<a name="FNanchor_386_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_388"><sup>[386]</sup></a> a
dish unknown elsewhere, so there is a bone for the gastronomers to pick.
Honest John Wood,<a name="FNanchor_387_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_389"><sup>[387]</sup></a> my old friend, dined with <a name="Page_342"></a>us. I only regret I
cannot understand him, as he has a very powerful memory, and much
curious information. The whole day of pleasure was damped by the news of
the King's death; it was fully expected, however, as the termination of
his long illness. But he was very good to me personally, and a kind
sovereign. The common people and gentry join in their sorrow. Much is
owing to a kindly recollection of his visit to this country, which gave
all men an interest in him.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 29.&mdash;The business of the Court was suspended, so back I came,
without stop or stay, and to work went I. As I had risen early I was
sadly drowsy; however, I fought and fagged away the day. I am still in
hope to send my whole manuscript to Ballantyne before the 10th July.
Well, I must devise something to myself; I must do something better than
this Demonological trash. It is nine o'clock, and I am weary, yea, my
very spirit's tired.<a name="FNanchor_388_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_390"><sup>[388]</sup></a> After ten o'clock Mr. Daveis,<a name="FNanchor_389_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_391"><sup>[389]</sup></a> an American
barrister of eminence, deputed to represent the American States in a
dispute concerning the boundaries of Nova Scotia and New England, with
an introduction to me from Mr. Ticknor, called. I was unable to see him,
and put him off till to-morrow morning at breakfast.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 30.&mdash;The new King was proclaimed, and the College of Justice took
the oaths. I assisted Mr. Daveis, who is a pleasant and well-informed
man, to see the ceremony, which, probably, he would hardly witness in
his own country. A day of noise and bustle. We dined at Mr. and Mrs.
Strange, <i>ch&egrave;re exquise</i> I suppose. Many friends of the Arniston family.
I thought there was some belief of Lord Melville losing his place. That
he may exchange it for another is very likely, but I think the Duke will
not desert him who adhered to him so truly.</p>
<a name="Page_343"></a>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="JULY_1830"></a><h2>JULY.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>July</i> 1.&mdash;Mr. Daveis breakfasted with me. On nearer acquaintance, I was
more galled by some portion of continental manners than I had been at
first, so difficult is it for an American to correct his manner to our
ideas of perfect good-breeding.<a name="FNanchor_390_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_392"><sup>[390]</sup></a> I did all that was right, however,
and asked Miss Ferrier, whom he admires prodigiously, to meet him at
dinner. Hither came also a young friend, so I have done the polite thing
every way. Thomson also dined with us. After dinner I gave my strangers
an airing round the Corstorphine hills, and returned by the Cramond
road. I sent to Mr. Gibson, Cadell's project for Lammas, which raises
&pound;15,000 for a dividend of 3s. to be then made. I think the trustees
should listen to this, which is paying one-half of my debt.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 2.&mdash;Have assurances from John Gibson that &pound;15,000 should be
applied as I proposed. If this can be repeated yearly up to 1835 the
matter is ended, and well ended; yet, woe's me! the public change their
taste, and their favourites get old. Yet if I was born in 1771, I shall
only be sixty in 1831, and, by the same reasoning, sixty-four in 1835,
so I may rough it out, yet be no Sir Robert Preston. At any rate, it is
all I have to trust to.</p>

<p>I did a morning's task, and was detained late at the Court; came home,
ate a hearty dinner, slumbered after it in spite <a name="Page_344"></a>of my teeth, and made
a poor night's work of it. One's mind gets so dissipated by the fagging,
yet insignificant, business of the offices; my release comes soon, but I
fear for a term only, for I doubt if they will carry through the Court
Bill.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 3.&mdash;My day began at seven as usual. Sir Adam came to breakfast. I
read Southey's edition of the <i>Pilgrim's Progress,</i> and think of
reviewing the same. I would I had books at hand. To the Court, and
remained till two; then went to look at the drawings for repairing
Murthly, the house of Sir John or James Stewart, now building by
Gillespie Graham, and which he has planned after the fashion of James
VI.'s reign, a kind of bastard Grecian<a name="FNanchor_391_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_393"><sup>[391]</sup></a>&mdash;very fanciful and pretty
though. Read Hone's <i>Every-day Book</i>, and with a better opinion of him
than I expected from his anti-religious frenzy. We are to dine with the
Skenes to-day.</p>

<p>Which we did accordingly, meeting Mr. and Mrs. Strange, Lord Forbes, and
other friends.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 4.&mdash;Was a complete and serious day of work, only interrupted in
the evening by&mdash;&mdash;, who, with all the freedom and ease of continental
manners, gratified me with his gratuitous presence. Yet it might have
been worse, for his conversation is well enough, but it is strange want
of tact to suppose one must be alike welcome to a stranger at all hours
of the day; but I have stuffed the portfolio, so do not grudge
half-an-hour.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 5.&mdash;I was up before seven and resumed my labours, and by
breakfast-time I had reached p. 133; it may reach to 160 or 170 as I
find space and matter. Buchanan<a name="FNanchor_392_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_394"><sup>[392]</sup></a> came and wrote about fifteen of his
pages, equal to mine in proportion of three to one. We are therefore
about p. 138, and in sight of land. At two o'clock went to bury poor
George Burnet, the son of Gilbert Innes, in as heavy a rain as I ever
saw. Was in Shandwick Place again by four and made<a name="Page_345"></a> these entries. I
dine to-day with the Club; grant Heaven it fair before six o'clock!</p>

<p>We met at Barry's,<a name="FNanchor_393_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_395"><sup>[393]</sup></a> and had a gallant dinner, but only few of our
number was present. Alas! sixty does not rally to such meetings with the
alacrity of sixteen, and our Club has seen the space between these
terms. I was home and abed when Charles arrived and waked me. Poor
fellow! he is doing very well with his rheumatic limbs.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 6.&mdash;I did little this morning but correct some sheets, and was at
the Court all morning. About two I called at Mr. Cadell's, and I learned
the dividend was arranged. Sir Adam fell in with us, and laid anchors to
windward to get an invitation to Cockenzie for next year, being struck
with my life-like description of a tiled haddock. I came home much
fagged, slept for half-an-hour (I don't like this lethargy), read <i>I
Promessi Sposi</i>, and was idle. Miss Kerr dined and gave us music.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 7.&mdash;This morning corrected proofs, with which J.B. proceeds
lazily enough, and alleges printing reasons, of which he has plenty at
hand. Though it was the Teind Wednesday the devil would have it that
this was a Court of Session day also for a cause of mine; so there I sat
hearing a dozen cases of augmentation of stipend pleaded, and wondering
within myself whether anything can be predicated of a Scottish parish,
in which there cannot be discovered a reason for enlarging the
endowments of the minister. I returned after two, with a sousing shower
for companion; I got very wet and very warm. But shall we go mourn for
that, my dear?<a name="FNanchor_394_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_396"><sup>[394]</sup></a> I rather like a flaw of weather; it shows something
of the old man is left. I had Mr. Buchanan to help pack my papers and
things, and got through part of that unpleasant business.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 8.&mdash;I had my letters as usual, but no proofs till I was just
going out. Returning from the Court met Skene, <a name="Page_346"></a>who brought me news that
our visit was at an end for Saturday, poor Colin having come to town
very unwell. I called to see him, and found him suffering under a degree
of slow palsy, his spirits depressed, and his looks miserable, worse a
great deal than when I last saw him. His wife and daughter were in the
room, dreadfully distressed. We spoke but a few words referring to
recovery and better days, which, I suspect, neither of us hoped.<a name="FNanchor_395_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_397"><sup>[395]</sup></a>
For I looked only on the ghost of my friend of many a long day; and he,
while he <a name="Page_347"></a>said to see me did him good, must have had little thought of
our meeting under better auspices. We shall, of course, go straight to
Abbotsford, instead of travelling by Harcus as we intended.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 9.&mdash;Two distressed damsels on my hands, one, a friend of Harriet
Swinton, translates from the Italian a work on the plan of <i>I Promessi
Sposi</i>, but I fear she must not expect much from the trade. A
translation with them is a mere translation&mdash;that is, a thing which can
be made their own at a guinea per sheet, and they will not have an
excellent one at a higher rate. Second is Miss Young, daughter of the
excellent Dr. Young of Hawick. If she can, from her father's letters and
memoranda, extract materials for a fair simple account of his life, I
would give my name as editor, and I think it might do, but for a large
publication&mdash;Palabras, neighbour Dogberry,<a name="FNanchor_396_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_399"><sup>[396]</sup></a> the time is by. Dined
with the Bannatyne, where we had a lively party. Touching the songs, an
old <i>rou&eacute;</i> must own an improvement in the times, when all paw-paw words
are omitted, and naughty innuendos <i>gaz&eacute;s</i>. One is apt to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,<br /></span>
<span>A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'<br /></span>
<span>And such protest of pepper-gingerbread.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_397_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_400"><sup>[397]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I think there is more affectation than improvement in the new mode.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 10.&mdash;Rose rather late: the champagne and turtle, I suppose, for
our reform includes no fasting. Then poor Ardwell came to breakfast;
then Dr. Young's daughter. I have projected with Cadell a plan of her
father's life, to be edited by me.<a name="FNanchor_398_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_401"><sup>[398]</sup></a> If she does but tolerably, she
may have a fine thing of it. Next came the Court, where sixty judgments
were pronounced and written by the Clerks, I hope <a name="Page_348"></a>all correctly, though
an error might well happen in such a crowd, and&mdash;&mdash;, one of the best men
possible, is beastly stupid. Be that as it may, off came Anne, Charles,
and I for Abbotsford. We started about two, and the water being too deep
didn't arrive till past seven; dinner, etc., filled up the rest of the
day.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 11, <i>Abbotsford</i>.&mdash;Corrected my proofs and the lave of it till
about one o'clock. Then started for a walk to Chiefswood, which I will
take from station to station,<a name="FNanchor_399_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_402"><sup>[399]</sup></a> with a book in my pouch. I have begun
<i>Lawrie Todd</i>, which ought, considering the author's undisputed talents,
to have been better. He might have laid Cooper aboard, but he follows
far behind. No wonder: Galt, poor fellow, was in the King's Bench when
he wrote it. No whetter of genius is necessity, though said to be the
mother of invention.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 12.&mdash;Another wet day, but I walked twice up and down the terrace,
and also wrote a handsome scrap of copy, though mystified by the want of
my books, and so forth. Dr. and Mrs. Lockhart and Violet came to
luncheon and left us to drive on to Peebles. I read and loitered and
longed to get my things in order. Got to work, however, at seven in the
morning.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 13.&mdash;Now &quot;what a thing it is to be an ass!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_400_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_403"><sup>[400]</sup></a> I have a letter
from a certain young man, of a sapient family, announcing that his
sister had so far mistaken my attentions as to suppose I was only
prevented by modesty from stating certain wishes and hopes, etc. The
party is a woman of rank: so far my vanity may be satisfied. But to
think I would wish to appropriate a grim grenadier made to mount guard
at St. James's! The Lord deliver me! I excused myself with little
picking upon the terms, and there was no occasion for much delicacy in
repelling such an attack.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 14.&mdash;The Court of Session Bill is now committed <a name="Page_349"></a>in the House of
Lords, so it fairly goes on this season, and I have, I suppose, to look
for my <i>cong&eacute;</i>. I can hardly form a notion of the possibility that I am
not to return to Edinburgh. My clerk Buchanan came here, and assists me
to finish the <i>Demonology Letters</i>, and be d&mdash;d to them. But it is done
to their hand. Two ladies, Mrs. Latouche of Dublin, and her niece, Miss
Boyle, came to spend a day or two. The aunt is a fine old lady; the
conversation that of a serious person frightened out of her wits by the
violence and superstition of our workers of miracles in the west.<a name="FNanchor_401_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_404"><sup>[401]</sup></a>
Miss Boyle is a pretty young woman, rather quiet for an Irish lass.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 16.&mdash;We visited at Lessudden yesterday, and took Mrs. Latouche
thither. To-day, as they had left us, we went alone to Major John's
house of Ravenswood and engaged a large party of cousins to dine
to-morrow.</p>

<p>In the evening a party of foreigners came around the door, and going out
I found Le Comte Ladislaus de Potocki, a great name in Poland, with his
lady and brother-in-law, so offered wine, coffee, tea, etc. The lady is
strikingly pretty. If such a woman as she had taken an affection for a
lame baronet, nigh sixty years old, it would be worth speaking about! I
have finished the <i>Demonology</i>.<a name="FNanchor_402_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_405"><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>July</i> 17.&mdash;Another bad day, wet past all efforts to walk, and
threatening a very bad harvest. Persecuted with begging letters; an
author's Pegasus is like a post-chaise leaving the door of the inn: the
number of beggars is uncountable. The language they hold of my character
for charity makes my good reputation as troublesome as that of Joseph
Surface.<a name="FNanchor_403_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_406"><sup>[403]</sup></a> A dinner of cousins, the young Laird of Raeburn, so he
must be called, though nearly as old as I am, at their head. His brother
Robert, who has been in <a name="Page_350"></a>India for forty years, excepting one short
visit: a fine manly fellow, who has belled the cat with fortune, and
held her at bay as a man of mould may. Being all kinsmen and friends, we
made a merry day of our re-union. All left at night.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 18.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Time runs, I know not how, away.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here am I beginning the second week of my vacation&mdash;though what needs me
note that?&mdash;vacation and session will probably be the same to me in the
future. The long remove must then be looked to, for the final signal to
break up, and that is a serious thought.</p>

<p>I have corrected two sets of proofs, one for the mail, another for the
Blucher to-morrow.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>No entry between July 18 and September 5</i>.]</p>

<p>     [Mr. Lockhart remarks that it was during this interval that the
     highest point of his recovery was reached. The following little
     note accompanied the review of Southey's <i>Bunyan</i> to Chiefswood on
     August 6th:&mdash;-</p>

<p>     &quot;Dear Lockhart, I send you the enclosed. I intended to have brought
     it myself with help of 'Daddy Dun,' but I find the weather is
     making a rain of it to purpose.</p>

<p>     &quot;I suppose you are all within doors, and the little gardeners all
     off work.&mdash;Yours, W.S.&quot;]</p>

<p>     A playful yet earnest petition, showing Sir Walter's continued
     solicitude for the welfare of the good 'Dominie Sampson,' was also
     written at this time to the Duke of Buccleuch:&mdash;</p>

<p>     &quot;ABBOTSFORD, <i>20th August</i>.</p>

<p>     &quot;The minister of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; having fallen among other black cocks of
     the season, emboldens me once more to prefer my humble request in
     favour of George Thomson, long tutor in this family. His case is so
     well known to your Grace that I would be greatly to blame if I
     enlarged upon it. His morals are irreproachable, his talents very
     respectable. He has some oddity of manner, but it is far from
     attaching to either the head or the heart....</p>

<p>     &quot;It would be felt by me among one of the deepest obligations of the
     many which I owe to the house of Buccleuch. I daresay your Grace
     has shot a score of black game to-day. Pray let your namesake bag a
     parson.&quot;</p></blockquote><a name="Page_351"></a>

<a name="SEPTEMBER_1830"></a><h2>SEPTEMBER</h2>
<br />

<p><i>September</i> 5.&mdash;In spite of resolution I have left my Diary for some
weeks, I cannot tell why. We have had the usual number of travelling
Counts and Countesses, Yankees male and female, and a
Yankee-Doodle-Dandy into the bargain, a smart young Virginia man. We
have had friends of our own also, the Miss Ardens, young Mrs. Morritt
and Anne Morritt, most agreeable visitors.<a name="FNanchor_404_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_407"><sup>[404]</sup></a> Cadell came out here
yesterday with his horn filled with good news. This will in effect put
an end to the trust; only the sales and produce must be pledged to
insure the last &pound;15,000 and the annuity interest of &pound;600. In this way
Mr. Cadell will become half-partner in the remaining volumes of the
books following <i>St. Ronan's</i>; with all my heart, but he must pay well
for it, for it is good property. Neither is any value stated for
literary profits; yet, four years should have four novels betwixt
1830-4. This at &pound;2500 per volume might be &pound;8000, which would diminish
Mr. Cadell's advance considerably. All this seems feasible enough, so my
fits of sullen alarm are ill placed. It makes me care less about the
terms I retire upon. The efforts by which we have advanced thus far are
new in literature, and what is gained is secure.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="DECEMBER_1830"></a><h2>DECEMBER.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>December</i> 20.&mdash;From September 5 to December 20 is a long gap, and I
have seen plenty of things worth recollecting, had I marked them down
when they were gliding past. But the time has gone by. When I feel
capable of taking it up, I will.</p>

<p>Little self will jostle out everything else, and my affairs, which in
some respects are excellent, in others, like the way of the world, are
far from being pleasant.</p>

<p>Of good I have the pleasure of saying I have my children well, and in
good health. The dividend of 3s. in the pound has been made to the
creditors, and the creditors have testified their sense of my labours by
surrendering my books, furniture, plate, and curiosities. I see some
friends of mine think this is not handsomely done. In my opinion it is
extremely so. There are few things so [easy] as to criticise the good
things one does, and to show that we ourselves would have done [more]
handsomely. But those who know the world and their own nature are always
better pleased with one kind action carried through and executed, than
with twenty that only glide through their minds, while perhaps they
tickle the imagination of the benevolent Barmecide who supposes both the
entertainment and the eater. These articles do not amount to less than
&pound;10,000 at least, and, without dispensing with them entirely, might
furnish me with a fund for my younger children.<a name="FNanchor_405_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_408"><sup>[405]</sup></a> Now, suppose these
creditors had not seriously carried their purpose into execution, the
transaction might have been afterw<a name="Page_354"></a>ards challenged, and the ease of mind
which it produced to me must have been uncertain in comparison. Well!
one-half of these claims are cleared off, furnished in a great measure
by one-half issue of the present edition of the Waverley Novels, which
had reached the 20th of the series.</p>

<p>It cannot be expected that twenty more will run off so fast; the later
volumes are less favourites, and are really less interesting. Yet when I
read them over again since their composition, I own I found them
considerably better than I expected, and I think, if other circumstances
do not crush them and blight their popularity, they will make their way.
Mr. Cadell is still desirous to acquire one-half of the property of this
part of the work, which is chiefly my own. He proposes assembling all my
detached works of fiction and articles in Annuals, so that the whole,
supposing I write, as is proposed, six new volumes, will run the
collection to fifty, when it is time to close it. Between cash advanced
on this property, and a profit on the sale of the second part, Mr.
Cadell thinks, having taken a year or two years' time, to gather a
little wind into the bag, I will be able to pay, on my part, a further
sum of &pound;30,000, or the moiety remaining of the whole debts, amounting
now to less than &pound;60,000.</p>

<p>Should this happy period arrive in or about the year 1832 the heavy work
will be wellnigh finished. Tor, although &pound;30,000 will still remain, yet
there is &pound;20,000 actually secured upon my life, and the remaining
&pound;10,000 is set against the sale of <i>Waverley</i>, which shall have been
issued; besides which there is the whole Poetry, <i>Bonaparte</i>, and
several other articles, equally [available] in a short time to pay up
the balance, and afford a very large reversion.</p>

<p>This view cannot be absolutely certain, but it is highly probable, and
is calculated in the manner in which Building Schemes [are dealt with],
and is not merely visionary. The <a name="Page_355"></a>year 1833 may probably see me again in
possession of my estate.</p>

<p>A circumstance of great consequence to my habits and comforts was my
being released from the Court of Session on November 1830 (18th day). My
salary, which was &pound;1300, was reduced to &pound;840. My friends, just then
leaving office, were desirous to patch up the deficiency with a pension.
I do not see well how they could do this without being exposed to
obloquy, which they shall not be on my account. Besides, though &pound;500 a
year is a round sum, yet I would rather be independent than I would have
it.</p>

<p>My kind friend the Lord Chief Commissioner offered to interfere to have
me named a Privy Councillor; but besides that when one is poor he ought
to avoid taking rank, I would be much happier if I thought any act of
kindness was done to help forward Charles; and, having said so much, I
made my bow, and declared my purpose of remaining satisfied with the
article of my knighthood. And here I am, for the rest of my life I
suppose, with a competent income, which I can [increase].</p>

<p>All this is rather pleasing, nor have I the least doubt that I could
make myself easy by literary labour. But much of it looks like winding
up my bottom for the rest of my life. But there is a worse symptom of
settling accounts, of which I have felt some signs.</p>

<p>Last spring, Miss Young, the daughter of Dr. Young, had occasion to call
on me on some business, in which I had hopes of serving her. As I
endeavoured to explain to her what I had to say, I had the horror to
find I could not make myself understood. I stammered, stuttered, said
one word in place of another&mdash;did all but speak; Miss Young went away
frightened enough, poor thing; and Anne and Violet Lockhart were much
alarmed. I was bled with cupping-glasses, took medicine, and lived on
panada; but in two or three days I was well again. The physicians
thought, or <a name="Page_356"></a>said at least, that the evil was from the stomach. It is
very certain that I have seemed to speak with an impediment, and I was,
or it might be fancied myself, troubled with a mispronouncing and
hesitation. I felt this particularly at the Election, and sometimes in
society. This went on till last November, when Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; came out to
make me a visit. I had for a long time taken only one tumbler of whisky
and water without the slightest reinforcement. This night I took a very
little drop, not so much as a bumper glass, of whisky altogether. It
made no difference on my head that I could discover, but when I went to
the dressing-room I sank stupefied on the floor. I lay a minute or
two&mdash;was not found, luckily, gathered myself up, and got to my bed. I
was alarmed at this second warning, consulted Abercrombie and Ross, and
got a few restrictive orders as to diet. I am forced to attend to them;
for, as Mrs. Cole says, &quot;Lack-a-day! a thimbleful oversets me.&quot;</p>

<p>To add to these feelings I have the constant increase of my lameness:
the thigh-joint, knee-joint, and ankle-joint.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 21.&mdash;I walk with great pain in the whole limb, and am at
every minute, during an hour's walk, reminded of my mortality. I should
not care for all this, if I was sure of dying handsomely. Cadell's
calculations would be sufficiently firm though the author of <i>Waverly</i>
had pulled on his last nightcap. Nay, they might be even more
trustworthy, if Remains, and Memoirs, and such like, were to give a zest
to the posthumous. But the fear is the blow be not sufficient to destroy
life, and that I should linger on an idiot and a show.<a name="FNanchor_406_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_409"><sup>[406]</sup></a>....</p>

<p>We parted on good terms and hopes.<a name="FNanchor_407_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_410"><sup>[407]</sup></a> But, fall back, <a name="Page_357"></a>fall edge,
nothing shall induce me to publish what I do not think advantageous to
the community, or suppress what is.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 23.&mdash;To add for this day to the evil thereof, I am obliged to
hold a Black-fishing Court at Selkirk. This is always a very unpopular
matter in one of our counties, as the salmon never do get up to the
heads of the waters in wholesome season, and are there in numbers in
spawning-time. So that for several years during the late period, the
gentry, finding no advantage from preserving the spawning fish,
neglected the matter altogether in a kind of dudgeon, and the peasantry
laid them waste at their will. As the property is very valuable, the
proprietors down the country agreed to afford some additional passage
for fish when the river is open, providing they will protect the
spawning fish during close-time. A new Act has been passed, with heavy
penalties and summary powers of recovery. Some persons are cited under
it to-day; and a peculiar licence of poaching having distinguished the
district of late years, we shall be likely to have some disturbance.
They have been holding a meeting for reform in Selkirk, and it will be
difficult to teach them that this consists in anything else save the
privilege of obeying only such laws as please them. We shall see, but I
would have counselled the matter to have been delayed for a little
season. I shall do my duty, however. Do what is right, come what will.</p><a name="Page_358"></a>

<p>Six black-fishers were tried, four were condemned. All went very quietly
till the conclusion, when one of the criminals attempted to break out. I
stopped him for the time with my own hand.<a name="FNanchor_408_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_411"><sup>[408]</sup></a> But after removing him
from the Court-house to the jail he broke from the officers, who are
poor feeble old men, the very caricature of peace officers.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 24.&mdash;This morning my old acquaintance and good friend Miss
Bell Ferguson died after a short illness: an old friend, and a woman of
the most excellent condition. The last two or almost three years were
very sickly.</p>

<p>A bitter cold day. Anne drove me over to Huntly Burn to see the family.
I found Colonel Ferguson and Captain John, R.N., in deep affliction,
expecting Sir Adam hourly. Anne sets off to Mertoun, and I remain alone.
I wrote to Walter about the project of making my succession in movables.
J.B. sent me praises of the work I am busy with.<a name="FNanchor_409_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_412"><sup>[409]</sup></a> But I suspect a
little <i>supercherie</i>, though he protests not. He is going to the country
without sending me the political article. But he shall either set up or
return it, as I won't be tutored by any one in what I do or forbear.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 25.&mdash;I have sketched a political article on a union of Tories
and an Income Tax. But I will not show my teeth if I find I cannot bite.
Arrived at Mertoun, and found with the family Sir John Pringle, Major
Pringle, and Charles Baillie. Very pleasant music by the Miss Pringles.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 26, [<i>Mertoun</i>].&mdash;Prayers after breakfast, being Sunday.
Afterwards I shut myself up in Mr. Scott's room.</p>

<p><a name="Page_359"></a>He has lately become purchaser of his grandfather's valuable library,
which was collected by Pope's Lord Marchmont. Part of it is a very
valuable collection of tracts during the great Civil War. I spent
several hours in turning them over, but I could not look them through
with any accuracy. I passed my time very pleasantly, and made some
extracts, however, and will resume my research another day.</p>

<p>Major Pringle repeated some pretty verses of his own composing.</p>

<p>I had never a more decided inclination to go loose, yet I know I had
better keep quiet.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 27, [<i>Abbotsford</i>].&mdash;Commences snow, and extremely bitter
cold. When I returned from Mertoun, half-frozen, I took up the <i>Magnum</i>,
and began to notify the romance called <i>Woodstock</i>, in which I got some
assistance from Harden's ancient tracts. I ought rather to get on with
<i>Robert of Paris</i>; but I have had all my life a longing to do something
else when I am called to particular labour,&mdash;a vile contradictory humour
which I cannot get rid of. Well, I can work at something, so at the
<i>Magnum</i> work I. The day was indeed broken, great part having been
employed in the return from Mertoun.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 28.&mdash;Drove down to Huntly Burn. Sir Adam very melancholy, the
death of his sister having come with a particular and shocking surprise
upon him. After half-an-hour's visit I returned and resumed the
<i>Magnum</i>.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 29.&mdash;Attended poor Miss Bell Ferguson's funeral. I sat by the
Rev. Mr. Thomson. Though ten years younger than me, I found the barrier
between him and me much broken down. We remember it though with more or
less accuracy. We took the same old persons for subjects of
correspondence of feeling and sentiment. The difference of ten years is
little after sixty has passed. In a cold day I saw poor Bell laid in her
cold bed. Life never parted with a less effort. Letter from Cadell
offering to advance <a name="Page_360"></a>on second series French Tales. This will come in
good time, and keep me easy. He proposes views for the <i>Magnum</i>. I fear
politics may disappoint them.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 30.&mdash;Meeting at Selkirk to-day about the new road to
Galashiels. It was the largest meeting I ever saw in Selkirkshire. We
gain the victory by no less than 14 to 4. I was named one of the
committee to carry the matter on, so in gaining my victory I think I
have caught a Tartar, for I have taken on trouble enough. Some
company,&mdash;Lord Napier, Scotts of Harden, Johnstone of Alva, Major
Pringle. In the evening had some private conversation with H.F.S. and
R.J., and think there is life in a mussel. More of this hereafter.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 31.&mdash;My two young friends left this morning, but not without
renewing our conversation of last night. We carried on the little
amusements of the day, and spent our Hogmanay pleasantly enough, in
spite of very bad auguries.</p><a name="Page_361"></a>

<br />

<p><i>January</i> 1, 1831.&mdash;I cannot say the world opens pleasantly with me this
new year. I will strike the balance. There are many things for which I
have reason to be thankful.</p>

<p><i>First</i>.&mdash;Cadell's plans seem to have succeeded, and he augurs well as
to the next two years, reckoning &pound;30,000 on the stuff now on hand, and
&pound;20,000 on the insurance money, and &pound;10,000 to be borrowed somehow. This
will bring us wonderfully home.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>.&mdash;Cadell is of opinion if I meddle in politics, and I am
strongly tempted to do so, I shall break the milk-pail, and threatens me
with the fate of Basil Hall, who, as he says, destroyed his reputation
by writing impolitic politics. Well, it would be my risk, and if I can
do some good, which I rather think I can, is it right or manly to keep
myself back?</p>

<p><i>Third</i>.&mdash;I feel myself decidedly weaker in point of health, and am now
confirmed I have had a paralytic touch. I speak and read with
embarrassment, and even my handwriting seems to stammer. This general
failure</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;With mortal crisis doth portend,<br /></span>
<span>My days to appropinque an end.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_410_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_413"><sup>[410]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I am not solicitous about this, only if I were worthy I would pray God
for a sudden death, and no interregnum between I cease to exercise
reason and I cease to exist.</p>

<p>The Scotts of Harden, Pringles of Stitchill, and Russells of Ashestiel,
are all here; I am scarce fit for company though.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 2.&mdash;Held a great palaver with the Scotts, etc.</p>

<p><a name="Page_364"></a>I find my language apt to fail me; but this is very like to be fancy,
and I must be cautious of giving way to it. This cautions me against
public exertion much more than Cadell's prognostications, which my blood
rises against, and which are ill calculated to keep me in restraint. We
dozed through a gloomy day, being the dullest of all possible thaws.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 3.&mdash;I had a letter from the Lord Chief Commissioner,
mentioning the King's intention to take care of Charles's interests and
promotion in the Foreign Office, an additional reason why I should not
plunge rashly into politics, yet not one which I can understand as
putting a padlock on my lips neither. I may write to L.C.C. that I may
be called on to express an opinion on the impending changes, that I have
an opinion, and a strong one, and that I hope this fresh favour [may not
be regarded] as padlocking my lips at a time when it would otherwise be
proper to me to speak or write. I am shocked to find that I have not the
faculty of delivering myself with facility&mdash;an embarrassment which may
be fanciful, but is altogether as annoying as if real.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 4.&mdash;A base, gloomy day, and dispiriting in proportion. I
walked out with Swanston<a name="FNanchor_411_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_414"><sup>[411]</sup></a> for about an hour: everything gloomy as
the back of the chimney when there is no fire in it. My walk was a
melancholy one, feeling myself weaker at every step and not very able to
speak. This surely cannot be fancy, yet it looks something like it. If I
knew but the extent at which my inability was like to stop, but every
day is worse than another. I have trifled much time, too much; I must
try to get afloat to-morrow, perhaps getting an amanuensis might spur me
on, for one-half is nerves. It is a sad business though.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 5.&mdash;Very indifferent, with more awkward feelings than I can
well bear up against. My voice sunk and my head strangely confused. When
I begin to form <a name="Page_365"></a>my ideas for conversation expressions fail me, even in
private conversation, yet in solitude they are sufficiently arranged. I
incline to hold that these ugly symptoms are the work of imagination;
but, as Dr. Adam Ferguson,<a name="FNanchor_412_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_415"><sup>[412]</sup></a> a firm man if ever there was one in the
world, said on such an occasion, What is worse than imagination? As Anne
was vexed and frightened, I allowed her to send for young Clarkson. Of
course he could tell but little, save what I knew before.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 6.&mdash;A letter from Henry Scott about the taking ground for
keeping the reform in Scotland upon the Scottish principles. I will
write him my private sentiments, but avoid being a <i>boute-feu</i>.</p>

<p>Go this day to Selkirk, where I found about 120 and more persons of that
burgh and Galashiels, who were sworn in as special constables, enough to
maintain the peace. What shocked me particularly was the weakness of my
voice and the confusion of my head attempting to address them, which was
really a poor affair. On my return I found the Rev. Mr. Milne of Quebec,
a friend of my sister-in-law. Another time would have been better for
company, but Captain John Ferguson and Mr. Laidlaw coming in to dinner,
we got over the day well enough.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 7.&mdash;A fine frosty day, and my spirits lighter. I have a letter
of great comfort from Walter, who in a manly, handsome, and dutiful
manner expressed his desire to possess the library and movables of every
kind at Abbotsford, with such a valuation laid upon them as I choose to
impose. This removes the only delay to making my will. Supposing the
literary property to clear the debts by aid of insurances and other
things, about 1835 it will come into my person, and I will appoint the
whole to work off the heritable debt of &pound;10,000. If the literary
property can produce that sum, besides what it has already done, I would
convey it to the three younger children.</p>
<a name="Page_366"></a>
<p><i>January</i> 8.&mdash;Spent much time in writing instructions for my last will
and testament. Sent off parcel by Dr. Milne, who leaves to-day. Have up
two boys for shop-lifting. Remained at Galashiels till four o'clock, and
returned starved. Could work none, and was idle all evening&mdash;try
to-morrow for a work-day; so loiter on.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 10.&mdash;Went over to Galashiels, and was busied the whole time
till three o'clock about a petty thieving affair, and had before me a
pair of gallows'-birds, to whom I could say nothing for total want of
proof, except, like the sapient Elbow, Thou shalt continue there; know
thou, thou shalt continue.<a name="FNanchor_413_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_416"><sup>[413]</sup></a> A little gallow brood they were, and
their fate will catch them. Sleepy, idle, and exhausted on this. Wrought
little or none in the evening.</p>

<p>Wrote a long letter to Henry [Scott], who is a fine fellow, and what I
call a heart of gold. He has sound parts, good sense, and is a true man.
Also, I wrote to my excellent friend the Lord Chief [Commissioner]. I
thought it right to say that I accepted with gratitude his Majesty's
goodness, but trusted it was not to bind me to keep my fingers from pen
and ink should a notion impress me that I could help the country. I
walked a little, to my exceeding refreshment. I am using that family
ungratefully. But I will not, for a punctilio, avoid binding, if I can,
a strong party together for the King and country, and if I see I can do
anything, or have a chance of it, I will not fear for the skin-cutting.
It is the selfishness of this generation that drives me mad.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;A hundred pounds?<br /></span>
<span>Ha! thou hast touched me nearly.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I will get a parcel copied to-morrow; wrote several letters at night.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 11.&mdash;Wrote and sent off three of my own pages in the morning,
then walked with Swanston. I tried to write before dinner, but, with
drowsiness and pain in my <a name="Page_367"></a>head, made little way. My friend Will Laidlaw
came in to dinner, and after dinner kindly offered his services as
amanuensis. Too happy was I, and I immediately plunged him into the
depths of <i>Count Robert</i>, so we got on three or four pages, worth
perhaps double the number of print. I hope it did not take him too
short, but after all to keep the press going without an amanuensis is
impossible, and the publishers may well pay a sponsible person. He comes
back to-morrow. It eases many of my anxieties, and I will stick to it. I
really think Mr. Laidlaw is pleased with the engagement for the time.
Sent off six close pages.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 12.&mdash;I have a visit from Mr. Macdonald the sculptor, who
wishes to model a head of me. He is a gentlemanlike man, and pleasant as
most sculptors and artists of reputation are, yet it is an awful tax
upon time. I must manage to dictate while he models, which will do well
enough.</p>

<p>So there we sat for three hours or four, I sitting on a stool mounted on
a packing-box, for the greater advantage; Macdonald modelling and
plastering away, and I dictating, without interval, to good-natured Will
Laidlaw, who wrought without intermission. It is natural to ask, Do I
progress? but this is too feverish a question. A man carries no scales
about him to ascertain his own value. I always remember the prayer of
Virgil's sailor in extremity:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Non jam prima peto Mnestheus, neque vincere certo;<br /></span>
<span>Quamquam O!&mdash;Sed superent quibus hoc, Neptune, dedisti!<br /></span>

<span>Et prohibete nefas!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_414_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_417"><sup>[414]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>
<br /><a name="Page_368"></a>

<p>We must to our oar; but I think this and another are all that even
success would prompt me to write; and surely those that have been my
defenders</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Have they so long held out with me untired,<br /></span>
<span>And stop they now for breath? Well, be it so.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_415_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_418"><sup>[415]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>January</i> 13.&mdash;Went to Selkirk on the business of the new high road. I
perceive Whytbank and my cousin Colonel Russell of Ashestiel are
disposed to peep into the expenses of next year's outlay, which must be
provided by loan. This will probably breed strife. Wrote a hint of this
to Charles Balfour. Agreed with Smith so far as contracting for the
Bridges at &pound;1200 each. I suspect we are something like the good manager
who distressed herself with buying bargains.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 15.&mdash;Gave the morning from ten till near two to Mr. Macdonald,
who is proceeding admirably with his bust. It is bloody cold work, but
he is an enthusiast and much interested; besides, I can sit and dictate
owing to Mr. Laidlaw, and so get forward, while I am advancing Lorenzo
di Guasco, which is his travelling name. I wrote several letters too,
and got through some business. Walked, and took some exercise between
one and three.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 16.&mdash;Being Sunday, read prayers. Mr. and Mrs. James<a name="FNanchor_416_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_419"><sup>[416]</sup></a> go to
look for a house, which they desire to take in this country. As Anne is
ill, the presence of strangers, though they are pleasant, is rather
annoying. Macdonald continues working to form a new bust out of my old
scalp. I think it will be the last sitting which I will be enticed to.
Thanks to Heaven, the work finishes to-morrow.<a name="FNanchor_417_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_420"><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_369"></a>
<p><i>January</i> 17.&mdash;This morning, when I came down-stairs, I found Mr.
Macdonald slabbering away at the model. He has certainly great
enthusiasm about his profession, which is a <i>sine qua non</i>. It was not
till twelve that a post-chaise carried off my three friends.</p>

<p>I had wrote two hours when Dr. Turner came in, and I had to unfold my
own complaints. I was sick of these interruptions, and dismissed Mr.
Laidlaw, having no hope of resuming my theme with spirit. God send me
more leisure and fewer friends to peck it away by tea-spoonfuls!</p>

<p>Another fool sends to entreat an autograph, which he <a name="Page_370"></a>should be ashamed
in civility to ask, as I am to deny it. I got notice of poor Henry
Mackenzie's death. He has long maintained a niche in Scottish
Literature&mdash;gayest of the gay, though most sensitive of the sentimental.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 18.&mdash;Came down from my bedroom at eight, and took a rummage in
the way of putting things to rights. Dictated to Laidlaw till about one
o'clock, during which time it was rainy. Afterwards I walked, sliding
about in the mud, and very uncomfortable. In fact, there is no mistaking
the three sufficients,<a name="FNanchor_418_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_421"><sup>[418]</sup></a> and Fate is now straitening its
circumvallations round me. Little likely to be better than I am. I am
heart-whole as a biscuit, and may last on as now for eight or ten years;
the thing is not uncommon, considering I am only in my sixtieth year. I
cannot walk; but the intense cold weather may be to blame in this. My
riding is but a scramble, but it may do well enough for exercise; and
though it is unpleasant to find one's enjoyment of hill and vale so much
abridged, yet still when I enjoy my books, and am without acute pain, I
have but little to complain of, considering the life I have led so long.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&quot;So hap what may;<br /></span>
<span>Time and the hour run through the roughest day.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_419_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_422"><sup>[419]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Laidlaw came down at ten, and we wrought till one. This should be a
good thing for an excellent man, and is an important thing to me, as it
saves both my eyesight and nerves, which last are cruelly affected by
finding those &quot;who look out of the windows&quot; grow gradually darker and
darker.<a name="FNanchor_420_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_423"><sup>[420]</sup></a> Rode out, or more properly, was carried out, into the woods
to see the course of a new road, which may serve to carry off the
thinnings of the trees, and for rides. It is very well lined, and will
serve both for beauty and convenience. Mr. Laidlaw engages to come back
to dinner, and finish two or <a name="Page_371"></a>three more pages. Met my agreeable and
lady-like neighbour, Mrs. Brewster, on my pony, and I was actually
ashamed to be seen by her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Sir Dennis Brand, and on so poor a steed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_421_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_424"><sup>[421]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I believe detestable folly of this kind is the very last that leaves us.
One would have thought I ought to have little vanity at this time o'
day; but it is an abiding appurtenance of the old Adam, and I write for
penance what, like a fool, I actually felt.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 19.&mdash;Wrote on by Mr. Laidlaw's assistance. Things go bobbishly
enough; we have a good deal finished before dinner. Henry Scott comes to
dine with me <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, and we have a grand dish of politics. The
friends of old Scotland want but a signal. A certain great lawyer says
that if Sir W.S. wrote another <i>Malachi</i> it would set more men on fire
than a dozen associations. This almost tempts me. But the canny lad says
moreover that to appeal to national partiality, <i>i.e.</i> that you should
call on Scotsmen to act like Scotsmen, is unfair, and he would be sorry
it was known he, late and future placeman, should encourage such paw-paw
doings. Yet if Sir W.S. could be got to stand forlorn hope, the legal
gentleman would suggest, etc. etc. Suggest and be d&mdash;d. Sir W.S. knows
when to [doff] his bonnet, and when to cock it in the face of all and
sundry. Moreover, he will not be made a cat's-paw of, look you now.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 20.&mdash;Wrought all morning; a monstrous packet of letters at
mid-day. Borrow honest Laidlaw's fingers in the evening. I hope his pay
will recompense him: it is better than &quot;grieve-ing&quot; or playing
Triptolemus.<a name="FNanchor_422_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_425"><sup>[422]</sup></a> Should be, if I am hard-working, 100 guineas, which,
with his house, cow, and free rent, would save, I believe, some painful
thoughts to him and his amiable wife and children. We will see how the
matter fudges. Almost finished the first volume.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 21.&mdash;James Ballantyne in ecstasies at our plan <a name="Page_372"></a>of an
amanuensis. I myself am sensible that my fingers begin to stammer&mdash;that
is, to write one word instead of another very often. I impute this to
fancy, the terrible agency of which is too visible in my illness, and it
encourages me to hope the fatal warning is yet deferred. I feel lighter
by a million ton since I made this discovery. If I can dictate freely,
and without hesitation, my fear to speak at the meeting about the road
was vain terror, and so <i>Andiamo Caracci.</i> Wrote some letters this
afternoon.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 22.&mdash;Mr. Laidlaw rather late of coming. One of his daughters
has been ill, and he is an approved physician. Pity when one so gifted
employs his skill on himself and family for all patients. We got on,
however, to page 46.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 23.&mdash;I wrought a little to-day. Walked to Chiefswood, or
rather from it, as far only as Habbie's Howe. Came home, cold indeed,
but hearty. Slept after dinner. I think the peep, real or imaginary, at
the gates of death has given me firmness not to mind little afflictions.
I have jumbled this and the preceding day strangely, when I went to
Chiefswood and Huntly Burn. I thought this a week-day.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 24.&mdash;Worked with Mr. Laidlaw, and, as the snow was on the
ground, did so without intermission, which must be sinking to the
spirits. Held on, however.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 25.&mdash;Same drizzling waste, rendering my footing insecure, and
leaving me no refuge but in sitting at home and working till one
o'clock. Then retired upon the Sheriff Court processes. Bran,<a name="FNanchor_423_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_426"><sup>[423]</sup></a> poor
fellow, lies yawning at my feet, and cannot think what is become of the
daily scamper, which is all his master's inability affords him. This
grieves me, by calling back the days of old. But I may call them as I
may,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Youth winna return, nor the days of lang syne.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a name="Page_373"></a><i>January</i> 26.&mdash;I have Skene and Mr. M'Culloch of Ardwell, to the relief
of my spirits and the diminishing of my time. Mr. Laidlaw joined us at
dinner.</p>

<p>Bitter cold.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 27.&mdash;So fagged with my frozen vigils that I slept till after
ten. When I lose the first two hours in the morning I can seldom catch
them again during the whole day.</p>

<p>A friendly visit from Ebenezer Clarkson of Selkirk, a medical gentleman
in whose experience and ingenuity I have much confidence, as well as his
personal regard for myself. He is quite sensible of the hesitation of
speech of which I complain, and thinks it arises from the stomach.
Recommends the wild mustard as an aperient. But the brightest ray of
hope is the chance that I may get some mechanical aid made by Fortune at
Broughton Street, which may enable me to mount a pony with ease, and to
walk without torture. This would, indeed, be almost a restoration of my
youth, at least of a green old age full of enjoyment. The shutting one
out from the face of living nature is almost worse than sudden death.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 28.&mdash;I wrote with Laidlaw. It does not work clear; I do not
know why. The plot is, nevertheless, a good plot, and full of
expectation.<a name="FNanchor_424_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_427"><sup>[424]</sup></a> But there is a cloud over me, I think, and
interruptions are frequent. I creep on, however.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 29.&mdash;Much in the same way as yesterday, rather feeling than
making way. Mr. Williams and his brother came in after dinner. Welcome
both; yet the day was not happy. It consumed me an afternoon, which,
though well employed, and pleasantly, had the disagreeable effect of my
being kept from useful work.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 30.&mdash;Snow deep, which makes me alter my purpose of going to
town to-morrow. For to-day, my friends must amuse themselves as they
can.</p>

<p><a name="Page_374"></a><i>January</i> 31 <i>[to February</i> 9, <i>Edinburgh</i>].&mdash;Retain my purpose,
however, and set out for Edinburgh alone&mdash;that is, no one but my
servant. The snow became impassable, and in Edinburgh I remain immovably
fixed for ten days&mdash;that is, till Wednesday&mdash;never once getting out of
doors, save to dinner, when I went and returned in a sedan chair. I
commenced my quarantine in Mackenzie's Hotel,<a name="FNanchor_425_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_428"><sup>[425]</sup></a> where I was deadly
cold, and it was tolerably noisy. The second day Mr. Cadell made a point
of my coming to his excellent house, where I had no less excellent an
apartment and the most kind treatment&mdash;- that is, not making a show of
me, for which I was in but bad tune.<a name="FNanchor_426_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_429"><sup>[426]</sup></a> The physical folks,
Abercrombie and Ross, bled me with cupping-glasses, purged me
confoundedly, and restricted me of all creature comforts. But they did
me good, as I am sure they meant to do sincerely; and I got rid of a
giddy feeling, which I have been plagued with, and have certainly
returned much better. I did not neglect my testamentary affairs. I
executed my last will, leaving Walter burdened, by his own choice, with
&pound;1000 to Sophia, and another received at her marriage, and &pound;2000 to
Anne, and the same to Charles. He is to advance them money if they want
it; <a name="Page_375"></a>if not, to pay them interest, which is his own choice, otherwise I
would have sold the books and rattletraps. I have made provisions for
clearing my estate by my publications, should it be possible; and should
that prove possible, from the time of such clearance being effected, to
be a fund available to all my children who shall be alive or leave
representatives. My bequests must, many of them, seem hypothetical; but
the thing, being uncertain, must be so stated.</p>

<p>Besides, during the unexpected stay in town, I employed Mr. Fortune, an
ingenious artist,<a name="FNanchor_427_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_430"><sup>[427]</sup></a> to make a machine to assist my lame leg,&mdash;an odd
enough purchase to be made at this time of day, yet who would not
purchase ease? I dined with the Lord Chief Commissioner, with the Skenes
twice, with Lord Medwyn, and was as happy as anxiety about my daughter
would permit me.</p>

<p>The appearance of the streets was most desolate: the hackney-coaches,
with four horses, strolling about like ghosts, the foot-passengers few
but the lowest of the people.</p>

<p>I wrote a good deal of <i>Count Robert</i>, yet I cannot tell why my pen
stammers egregiously, and I write horridly incorrect. I long to have
friend Laidlaw's assistance.</p>
<a name="Page_376"></a>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="FEBRUARY_1831"></a><h2>FEBRUARY.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>February</i> 9,<i>[Abbotsford].</i>&mdash;A heavy and most effective thaw coming on
I got home about five at night, and found the haugh covered with water,
dogs, pigs, cows, to say nothing of human beings, all who slept at the
offices in danger of being drowned. They came up to the mansion-house
about midnight, with such various clamour, that Anne thought the house
was attacked by Captain Swing and all the Radicals.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 10.&mdash;I set to work with Mr. Laidlaw, and had after that a
capital ride; my pony, little used, was somewhat frisky, but I rode on
to Huntly Burn. Began my diet on my new r&eacute;gime, and like it well,
especially porridge to supper. It is wonderful how old tastes rise.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 11.&mdash;Wrought again to-day, and John Swanston walked with me.
Wrote many letters, and sent copy to Ballantyne. Rode as usual. It is
well enough to ride every day, but confoundedly tiresome to write it
down.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 13.&mdash;I did not ask down Mr. Laidlaw, thinking it fair to
spare his Sunday. I had a day of putting to rights, a disagreeable work
which must be done. I took the occasion to tell Mr. Cadell that
<i>Malachi</i> will break forth again; but I will not make a point of it with
him. I do not fear there will be as many to strike up as to strike down,
and I have a strong notion we may gain the day. I have a letter from the
Duchess of Wellington, asking a copy of Melville's Memoirs. She shall
have it if it were my last.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 14.&mdash;I had hardly begun my letter to Mr.<a name="Page_377"></a> Cadell than I began
also to &quot;pull in resolution.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_428_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_431"><sup>[428]</sup></a> I considered that I had no means of
retreat; and that in all my sober moments, meaning my unpassionate ones,
for the doctors have taken from me the means of producing Dutch courage,
I have looked on political writing as a false step, and especially now
when I have a good deal at stake. So, upon the whole, I cancelled the
letter announcing the publication. If this was actually meanness it is a
foible nobody knows of. Anne set off for Edinburgh after breakfast. Poor
girl, she is very nervous. I wrote with Mr. L. till one&mdash;then had a walk
till three&mdash;then wrote this diary till four. Must try to get something
for Mr. Laidlaw, for I am afraid I am twaddling. I do not think my head
is weakened, but a strange vacillation makes me suspect. Is it not thus
that men begin to fail, becoming, as it were, infirm of purpose,</p>

<span>No more of that ...&quot;<a name="FNanchor_429_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_432"><sup>[429]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet, why be a child about it? what must be, will be.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 15.&mdash;I wrote and corrected through the long day till one
o'clock; then rode out as far as Dr. Scott's, and called on him. Got a
fresh dose of proofs at Mathieson's, and returned home. At nine o'clock
at night had a card from Miss Bell [Maclachlan], wishing to speak to me
about some Highland music. Wrote for answer I knew nothing of the
matter, but would be happy to see Mrs. and Miss Bell to breakfast. I had
a letter of introduction by Robert Chambers, which I declined, being
then unwell. But as Trotter of Braid said, &quot;The ladies maun come.&quot;</p>

<p><i>February</i> 16.&mdash;Mrs. and Miss Bell Maclachlan of the West Highlands,
mother and daughter, made their way to me to breakfast. I did not wish
to see them, being strangers; but she is very pretty&mdash;that is, the
daughter&mdash;and enthusiastic, and that is always flattering to an old
gentleman. She <a name="Page_378"></a>wishes to have words to Celtic melodies, and I have
promised her some, to the air of Crochallan, and incline to do her good,
perhaps, to the extent of getting her words from Lord Francis Leveson
Gower, Lockhart, and one or two others. We parted, she pleased with my
willing patronage, and I with an uncommon handsome countenance she
showed me.</p>

<p>This detained Mr. Laidlaw <i>re infecta</i>, and before I had written a page
the pony came to the door; but wrote something after dinner.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 17 and 18.&mdash;We had the usual course of food, study, and
exercise in the forenoon. Was extremely sleepy in the afternoon, which
made, I fear, but bad work. We progress, however. In riding met Sir Adam
Ferguson, and asked him and his brother the Colonel to dinner to-morrow.
Wrote in the meantime as usual.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 19.&mdash;Plagued by the stay for leg starting a screw bolt, which
is very inconvenient. Sent off, this morning, proofs as far as end of
first volume, and 20 manuscript pages, equal to about a quarter of the
second. Is it good or not? I cannot say. I think it better as it goes
on; and so far so good. I am certain I have written worse abomination,
as John Ballantyne, poor fellow, used to say.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 20.&mdash;Wrote five pages this morning; then rode out to the hill
and looked at some newly planted, rather transplanted, trees. Mr.
Laidlaw gone for the day. I trust I shall have proofs to correct. In the
meantime I may suck my paws and prepare some copy, or rather assemble
the raw material.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 21.&mdash;I made up parcels by mail-coach and Blucher to go
to-morrow&mdash;second volume <i>Redgauntlet</i>. At one fetched a walk through
wet and dry, looking at the ravages of the late flood. After I came in,
till two hours after tea-time, busied with the Sheriff Court processes,
which<a name="Page_379"></a> I have nearly finished. After this I will lounge over my
annotating. The <i>Tales of the Crusades</i> come next.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 22.&mdash;Wrought with Mr. L. from ten to three, then took the
pony carriage, with the purpose of going to Chiefswood, but a heavy
squall came on with snow, so we put about-ship and returned. Read
Lyttelton's <i>History of England</i> to get some notes for <i>Crusaders</i>, vol.
i. After dinner Mr. Laidlaw from six to eight. Sent off six pages.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 23, 24, 25.&mdash;These three days I can hardly be said to have
varied from my ordinary.</p>

<p>Rose at seven, dressed before eight, wrote letters, or did any little
business till a quarter past nine. Then breakfast. Mr. Laidlaw comes
from ten till one. Then take the pony, and ride <i>quantum mutatus</i> two or
three miles, John Swanston walking by my bridle-rein lest I fall off.
Come home about three or four. Then to dinner on a single plain dish and
half a tumbler, or by'r lady three-fourths of a tumbler, of whisky and
water. Then sit till six o'clock, when enter Mr. Laidlaw again, and work
commonly till eight. After this, work usually alone till half-past nine,
then sup on porridge and milk, and so to bed. The work is half done. If
any [one] asks what time I take to think on the composition, I might
say, in one point of view, it was seldom five minutes out of my head the
whole day. In another light, it was never the serious subject of
consideration at all, for it never occupied my thoughts entirely for
five minutes together, except when I was dictating to Mr. Laidlaw.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 26.&mdash;Went through the same routine, only, being Saturday, Mr.
Laidlaw does not come in the evening. I think there is truth in the
well-known phrase, <i>Aurora musis amica</i>. I always have a visit of
invention between six and seven&mdash;that is, if anything has been plaguing
me, in the way of explanation, I find it in my head when I wake. I have
need of it to-night.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 27.&mdash;Being Saturday, no Mr. Laidlaw came <a name="Page_380"></a>yesterday evening,
nor to-day, being Sunday. Truth is, I begin to fear I was working too
hard, and gave myself to putting things in order, and working at the
<i>Magnum</i>, and reading stupid German novels in hopes a thought will
strike me when I am half occupied with other things. In fact, I am like
the servant in the <i>Clandestine Marriage,</i><a name="FNanchor_430_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_433"><sup>[430]</sup></a> who assures his mistress
he always watches best with his eyes shut.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 28.&mdash;Past ten, and Mr. Laidlaw, the model of a clerk in other
respects, is not come yet. He has never known the value of time, so is
not quite accurate in punctuality; but that, I hope, will come if I can
drill him to it without hurting him. I think I hear him coming. I am
like the poor wizard who is first puzzled how to raise the devil and
then how to employ him. But <i>vogue la gal&egrave;re</i>. Worked till one, then
walked with great difficulty and pain till half-past two. I think I can
hardly stir without my pony, which is a sad pity. Mr. Laidlaw dines
here.</p>
<a name="Page_381"></a>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="MARCH_1831"></a><h2>MARCH.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>March</i> 1, 2, 3.&mdash;All these three days I wrote forenoon and fagged
afternoon. Kept up the ball indifferent well, but began to tire on the
third, and suspected that I was flat&mdash;a dreary suspicion, not easily
chased away when once it takes root.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 4.&mdash;Laid aside the novel, and began with vigour a review of
Robson's Essay on Heraldry;<a name="FNanchor_431_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_434"><sup>[431]</sup></a> but I missed some quotations which I
could not get on without. I gave up, and took such a rash ride nowadays.
Returned home, and found Colonel Russell there on a visit. Then we had
dinner, and afterwards the making up this miserable Journal.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 5.&mdash;I have a letter from our member, Whytbank, adjuring me to
assist the gentlemen of the county with an address against the Reform
Bill, which menaces them with being blended with Peeblesshire, and
losing of consequence one half of their franchise. Mr. Pringle conjures
me not to be very nice in choosing my epithets. Mr. Pringle, Torwoodlee,
comes over and speaks to the same purpose, adding, it will be the
greatest service I can do the county, etc. This, in a manner, drives me
out of a resolution to keep myself clear of politics, and &quot;let them
fight dog, fight bear.&quot; But I am too easy to be persuaded to bear a
hand. The young Duke of Buccleuch comes to visit me also; so I promised
to shake my duds and give them a cast of my calling, fall back, fall
edge.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 7-10.&mdash;In these four days I drew up, with much anxiety, an
address reprobatory of the Bill, both with respect <a name="Page_382"></a>to Selkirkshire, and
in its general purport. I was not mealy-mouthed, and those who heard the
beginning could hardly avoid listening to the end. It was certainly in
my best style, and would have made a deal of noise. From the
uncompromising style it would have attracted attention. Mr. Laidlaw,
though he is on t'other side on the subject, thinks it the best thing I
ever wrote; and I myself am happy to find that it cannot be said to
smell of the apoplexy. The pointed passages were, on the contrary,
clever and well put. But it was too declamatory, too much like a
pamphlet, and went far too generally into opposition to please the
country gentlemen, who are timidly inclined to dwell on their own
grievances rather than the public wrongs.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 11.&mdash;This day we had our meeting at Selkirk. I found
Borthwickbrae (late member) had sent the form of an address, which was
finished by Mr. Andrew Lang.<a name="FNanchor_432_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_435"><sup>[432]</sup></a> It was the reverse of mine in every
respect. It was short, and to the point. It only contained a
remonstrance against the incorporation with [Peebles]shire, and left it
to be inferred that they approved the Bill in other respects.<a name="FNanchor_433_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_436"><sup>[433]</sup></a> As I
saw that it met the ideas of the meeting (six in number) better by far
than such an address as mine, I instantly put it in my pocket. But I
endeavoured to add to their complaint of a private wrong a general
clause, stating their sense of the hazard of passing a Bill full of such
violent innovations at once on the public. But though Harden, Alva, and
Torwoodlee voted for this measure, it was refused by the rest of the
meeting, to my disappointment; since in its present state it will not be
attended to, and is in fact too <a name="Page_383"></a>milk-and-water to attract notice. I am,
however, personally out of the scrape; I was a fool to stir such a mess
of skimmed milk with so honourable an action.<a name="FNanchor_434_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_437"><sup>[434]</sup></a> If some of the
gentlemen of the press get hold of this story, what would they make of
it, and how little would I care! One thing is clear: it gives me a right
to decline future interference, and let the world wag, <i>Sessa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_435_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_438"><sup>[435]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>March</i> 12.&mdash;Wrote the history of my four days' labour in vain to Sandy
Pringle, Whytbank, and so <i>transeat</i> with <i>c&aelig;teris erroribus</i>. I only
gave way to one jest. A ratcatcher was desirous to come and complete his
labours in my house, and I, who thought he only talked and laughed with
the servants, recommended him to go to the head courts and meetings of
freeholders, where he would find rats in plenty.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 13.&mdash;I have finally arranged a thorny transaction. Mr. Cadell
has an interest in some of the Novels, amounting to one-half; but the
following are entirely my own, viz.:&mdash;</p>

St. Ronan's Well,    3 vols.<br />
Tales of Crusaders,  4 &quot;<br />
First Chronicles,    2 &quot;<br />
Anne of Geierstein,  3 &quot;<br />
Redgauntlet,         3 &quot;<br />
Woodstock,           3 &quot;<br />
Second Chronicles,   3 &quot;<br />
Count Robert,        3 &quot;<br />

<p>In all, twenty-four volumes, which will begin printing after <i>Quentin
Durward</i>, and concludes the year 1831. For half the property he proposes
to pay 6000 guineas on 2d February 1831 [1832?]. I think that with this
sum, and others coming in, I may reduce the debt to &pound;45,000.</p>

<p>But I do not see clearly enough through this affair to accept this
offer. <i>First</i>, I cannot see that there is wisdom in engaging Mr. Cadell
in deep speculations, unless they served him very much. I am, in this
respect, a burnt child: <a name="Page_384"></a>I have not forgotten the fire, or rather the
furnace. <i>Second</i>, I think the property worth more, if publicly sold.
<i>Third</i>, I cannot see any reasons which should render it advantageous
for me to sell one half of this property, it being admittedly at the
same [time] highly judicious to keep the other half. This does not
fadge. <i>Fourth</i>, As to the immediate command of the money, I am not
pressed for it, not having any advantage by paying it a year or two
sooner or later. The actual proceeds of the sales will come in about
1834, and I daresay will not be far behind in amount the sum of &pound;6000.</p>

<p>In short, I will not sell on a rainy day, as our proverb says. I have
communicated my resolution to Cadell, to whom, no doubt, it will be a
disappointment, for which I am sorry, but cannot help it.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 14.&mdash;Had a very sensible and good-humoured answer from Mr.
Cadell, readily submitting to my decision. He mentions, what I am
conscious of, the great ease of accomplishing, if the whole is divided
into two halves. But this is not an advantage to me, but to them who
keep the books, and therefore I cannot be moved by it. It is the great
advantage of uniformity, of which Malachi Malagrowther tells so much. I
do not fear that Mr. Cadell will neglect the concern because he has not
the large share in it which he had in the other. He is, I think, too
honest a man. He has always shown himself every way willing and ready to
help me, and verily he hath his reward; and I can afford him on that
property a handsome percentage for the management. But if his fate was
to lose considerably by this transaction, I must necessarily be a
sufferer; if he be a great gainer, it is at my expense, so it is like
the children's game of &quot;Odds I win, evens you lose&quot;&mdash;so will say no more
about it. I think I will keep my ground nearly, so these cursed politics
do not ruin the country. I am unable to sit at good men's boards, and
Anne has gone to Mertoun to-day without me. I cannot walk or ride but
for a mile or two. <a name="Page_385"></a>Naboclish! never mind. I am satisfied that I am
heart-whole as a biscuit, and I may live to see the end of those affairs
yet. I am driving on the <i>Count of Paris</i> right merrily. I have plenty
of leisure, and <i>vive la plume</i>! I have arranged matters as I think for
the best, so will think no more about it.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 16.&mdash;The affair with Mr. Cadell being settled, I have only to
arrange a set of regular employment for my time, without over-fatiguing
myself. What I at present practise seems active enough for my capacity,
and even if I should reach the threescore and ten, from which I am
thrice three years distant, or nearer ten, the time may pass honourably,
usefully, and profitably, both to myself and other people. My ordinary
runs thus:&mdash;Rise at a quarter before seven; at a quarter after nine
breakfast, with eggs, or in the singular number, at least; before
breakfast private letters, etc.; after breakfast Mr. Laidlaw comes at
ten, and we write together till one. I am greatly helped by this
excellent man, who takes pains to write a good hand, and supplies the
want of my own fingers as far as another person can. We work seriously
at the task of the day till one o'clock, when I sometimes walk&mdash;not
often, however, having failed in strength, and suffering great pain even
from a very short walk. Oftener I take the pony for an hour or two and
ride about the doors; the exercise is humbling enough, for I require to
be lifted on horseback by two servants, and one goes with me to take
care I do not fall off and break my bones, a catastrophe very like to
happen. My proud promenade &agrave; pied or &agrave; cheval, as it happens, concludes
by three o'clock. An hour intervenes for making up my Journal and such
light work. At four comes dinner,&mdash;a plate of broth or soup, much
condemned by the doctors, a bit of plain meat, no liquors stronger than
small beer, and so I sit quiet to six o'clock, when Mr. Laidlaw returns,
and remains with me till nine or three quarters past, as it happens.<a name="Page_386"></a>
Then I have a bowl of porridge and milk, which I eat with the appetite
of a child. I forgot to say that after dinner I am allowed half a glass
of whisky or gin made into weak grog. I never wish for any more, nor do
I in my secret soul long for cigars, though once so fond of them. About
six hours per day is good working, if I can keep at it.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 17.&mdash;Little of this day, but that it was so uncommonly windy
that I was almost blown off my pony, and was glad to grasp the mane to
prevent its actually happening. Rode round by Brigends. I began the
third volume of <i>Count Robert of Paris</i>, which has been on the anvil
during all these vexatious circumstances of politics and health. But
&quot;the blue heaven bends over all.&quot; It may be ended in a fortnight if I
keep my scheme. But I will take time enough. This would be on Thursday.
I would like it much.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 18.&mdash;We get well on. <i>Count Robert</i> is finished so far as the
second goes, and some twenty [pages] of the third. <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i>, after long bedaubing me with compliment, has began to bedaub
Lockhart for my sake, or perhaps me for Lockhart's sake, with abuse.
Lockhart's chief offence seems to have been explaining the humbug of
showing up Hogg as a fool and blackguard in what he calls the
<i>Noctes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_436_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_439"><sup>[436]</sup></a> For me I care wonderfully little either for his flattery
or his abuse.<a name="FNanchor_437_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_440"><sup>[437]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_387"></a>
<p><i>March</i> 19.&mdash;I made a hard working day&mdash;almost equal to twenty pages,
but there was some reason for it, for Ballantyne writes me that the copy
sent will not exceed 265 pages when the end of volume ii. is reached; so
45 more pages must be furnished to run it out to page 329. This is an
awful cast back; so the gap is to be made up.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 20.&mdash;I thought I was done with politics, but it is easy getting
into the mess, and difficult and sometimes disgraceful to get out. I
have a letter from Sheriff Oliver, desiring me to go [to Jedburgh] on
Monday (to-morrow) and show countenance by adhering to a set of
propositions, being a resolution. Though not well drawn, they are
uncompromising enough; so I will not part company. Had a letter, too,
from Henry Scott. He still expects to refuse the Bill. I wrote him that
would but postpone the evil day, unless they could bring forward a
strong Administration, and, what is most essential, a system of finance;
otherwise it won't do. Henry has also applied to me for the rejected
address. But this I shall decline.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 22.&mdash;Went to-day at nine o'clock to the meeting. A great number
present, with a tribune full of Reformers, who showed their sense of
propriety by hissing, hooting, and making all sorts of noises; and these
unwashed artificers are from henceforth to select our legislators. There
was some speaking, but not good. I said something, for I could not sit
quiet.<a name="FNanchor_438_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_441"><sup>[438]</sup></a></p>

<p>We did not get home till about nine, having fasted the <a name="Page_388"></a>whole time.
James, the blockhead, lost my poor Spice, a favourite terrier. The fool
shut her in a stable, and somebody, [he] says, opened the door and let
her out. I suspect she is lost for aye, for she was carried to Jedburgh
in a post-chaise.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 23.&mdash;The measure carried by a single vote.<a name="FNanchor_439_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_442"><sup>[439]</sup></a> In other
circumstances one would hope for the interference of the House of Lords,
but it is all hab-nab at a venture. The worst is that there is a popular
party who want personal power, and are highly unfitted to enjoy it. It
has fallen easily, the old Constitution; no bullying Mirabeau to assail,
no eloquent Maury to defend. It has been thrown away like a child's
broken toy. Well trained, the good sense of the people is much trusted
to; we will see what it will do for us.<a name="FNanchor_440_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_443"><sup>[440]</sup></a></p>

<p>The curse of Cromwell on those whose conceit brought us to this pass.
<i>Sed transeat</i>. It is vain to mourn what cannot be mended.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 24.&mdash;Frank Grant and his lady came here. Frank will, I believe,
and if he attends to his profession, be one of the celebrated men of the
age. He is well known to me as the companion of my sons and the partner
of my daughters. In youth, that is in extreme youth, he was passionately
fond of fox-hunting and other sports, but not of any species of
gambling. He had also a strong passion for painting, and made a little
collection. As he had sense enough to feel that a younger brother's
fortune would not last long under the expenses of a good stud and a rare
<a name="Page_389"></a>collection of <i>chef-d'&#339;uvres</i>, he used to avow his intention to spend
his patrimony, about &pound;10,000, and then again to make his fortune by the
law. The first he soon accomplished. But the law is not a profession so
easily acquired, nor did Frank's talents lie in that direction. His
passion for painting turned out better. Nature had given him the rare
power of judging soundly of painting, and in a remarkable degree the
power of imitating it. Connoisseurs approved of his sketches, both in
pencil and oils, but not without the sort of criticisms made on these
occasions&mdash;that they were admirable for an amateur; but it could not be
expected that he should submit to the technical drudgery absolutely
necessary for a profession, and all that species of criticism which
gives way before natural genius and energy of character.</p>

<p>Meantime Frank Grant, who was remarkably handsome, and very much the man
of fashion, married a young lady with many possibilities, as Sir Hugh
Evans says.<a name="FNanchor_441_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_444"><sup>[441]</sup></a> She was eldest sister of Farquharson of Invercauld,
chief of that clan; and the young man himself having been almost
paralysed by the malaria in Italy, Frank's little boy by this match
becomes heir to the estate and chieftainship. In the meantime fate had
another chance for him in the matrimonial line. At Melton-Mowbray,
during the hunting season, he had become acquainted (even before his
first marriage) with a niece of the Duke of Rutland, a beautiful and
fashionable young woman, with whom he was now thrown into company once
more. It was a natural consequence that they should marry. The lady had
not much wealth, but excellent connections in society, to whom Grant's
good looks and good breeding made him very acceptable.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 25.&mdash;In the meantime Frank saw the necessity of doing something
to keep himself independent, having, I think, too much spirit to become
a Stulko,<a name="FNanchor_442_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_445"><sup>[442]</sup></a> drinking <a name="Page_390"></a>out the last glass of the bottle, riding the
horses which the laird wishes to sell, and drawing sketches to amuse the
lady and the children,&mdash;besides a prospect on Invercauld elevating him,
when realised, to the rank of the laird's father.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 26.&mdash;Grant was above all this, and honourably and manfully
resolved to cultivate his taste for painting, and become a professional
artist. I am no judge of painting, but I am conscious that Francis Grant
possesses, with much taste, a sense of beauty derived from the best
source, that of really good society, while in many modern artists, the
total want of that species of feeling is so great as to be revolting.
His former acquaintances render his immediate entrance into business
completely secure, and it will rest with himself to carry on his
success. He has, I think, that degree of energy and force of character
which will make him keep and enlarge any reputation which he may
acquire. He has confidence too in his own powers, always a requisite for
a young painter whose aristocratic pretensions must be envied by [his
less fortunate brethren].</p>

<p><i>March</i> 27.&mdash;Frank Grant is still with me, and is well pleased&mdash;I think
very deservedly so&mdash;with a cabinet picture of myself, armour, and so
forth, together with my two noble staghounds of the greyhound race. I
wish Cadell had got it; it is far better than Watson's&mdash;though his is
well too. The dogs sat charmingly, but the picture took up some
time.<a name="FNanchor_443_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_446"><sup>[443]</sup></a></p>
<a name="Page_391"></a>
<p><i>March</i> 28.&mdash;We went out a little ride. The weather most tempting, the
day beautiful. We rode and walked a little.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 29.&mdash;We had an hour's sitting of the dogs, and a good deal of
success. I cannot compose my mind on this public measure. It will not
please those whom it is the object to please.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 30.&mdash;Robert Dundas<a name="FNanchor_444_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_447"><sup>[444]</sup></a> and his wife&mdash;Miss Durham that was&mdash;came
to spend a day or two. I was heartily glad <a name="Page_392"></a>to see him, being my
earliest and best friend's son. John Swinton came by Blucher, on the
part of an anti-Reform meeting in Edinburgh; exhorting me to take up the
pen, but I declined and pleaded health, which, God knows, I have a right
to urge. I might have urged also the chance of my breaking down, but
there would be a cry of this kind which might very well prove real.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 31.&mdash;Swinton returned in the forenoon yesterday after lunch. He
took my denial very quietly, and said it would be wrong to press me. I
have not shunned anything that came fairly on me, but I do not see the
sense of standing forth a champion. It is said that the Duke of
Buccleuch has been offered the title of Monmouth if he would cease to
oppose. He said there were two objections&mdash;they would not give it him if
he seriously thought of it, and he would not take it if they did. The
Dundases went off to-day. I was glad I had seen them, although visitors
rather interrupt work.</p><a name="Page_393"></a>

<a name="APRIL_1831"></a><h2>APRIL.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>April</i> 2.&mdash;Mr. Henry Liddell, eldest son of Lord Ravensworth, arrived
here. I like him and his brother Tom very much. They are what may be
termed fine men. Young Mackenzie of Cromarty came with him, who is a
fine lad and sings very beautifully. I knew his father and mother, and
was very glad to see him. They had been at Mertoun fishing salmon, with
little sport.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 3.&mdash;A letter from the Lord Chief Commissioner, reporting Lord
Palmerston and Sir Herbert Taylor's letters in Charles's favour. Wrote a
grateful answer, and resolved, that as I have made my opinion public at
every place where I could be called on or expected to appear, I will not
throw myself forward when I have nothing to say. May the Lord have mercy
upon us and incline our hearts to keep this vow!</p>

<p><i>April</i> 4.&mdash;Mr. Liddell and Hay Mackenzie left us this morning. Liddell
showed me yesterday a very good poem, worthy of Pope or Churchill, in
old-fashioned hexameters, called the [<i>illegible</i>]. He has promised me a
copy, for it is still being printed. There are some characters very well
drawn. The force of it belies the character of a Dandie, too hastily
ascribed to the author. He is accomplished as an artist and musician,
and certainly has a fine taste for poetry, though he may never cultivate
it.<a name="FNanchor_445_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_449"><sup>[445]</sup></a> He promises to bring his lady&mdash;who is very clever, but pretty
high, they say, in <a name="Page_394"></a>the temper&mdash;to spend a day or two with us after
leaving Edinburgh.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 5.&mdash;This fifth day of April is the March fair at Selkirk. Almost
every one of the family goes there, Mr. Laidlaw among others. I have a
hideous paralytic custom of stuttering with my pen, and cannot write
without strange blunders; yet I cannot find any failure in my intellect.
Being unable to write to purpose with my own hand, this forenoon was a
sort of holiday to me. The third volume of <i>Count Robert</i> is fairly
begun, but I fear I shall want stuff to fill it, for I would not
willingly bombast it with things inappropriate. If I could fix my mind
to the task to-day, my temper, notwithstanding my oath, sets strong
towards politics, where I would be sure of making a figure, and feel I
could carry with me a great part of the middle-class, who wait for a
shot between wind and water&mdash;half comic, half serious, which is a better
argument than most which are going. The regard of my health is what
chiefly keeps me in check. The provoking odium I should mind much less;
for there will always be as many for as against me, but it would be a
foolish thing to take flight to the next world in a political gale of
wind. If Cadell gave me the least encouragement I would give way to the
temptation. Meantime I am tugging at the chain for very eagerness. I
have done enough to incense people against me, without, perhaps, doing
so much as I could, would, or should have done.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 6.&mdash;I have written to Alva and Lord Elgin, explaining why I
cannot, as they encourage me to do, take upon me the cause of the
public, and bell-the-cat with the reformers. I think I have done enough
for an individual.</p>

<p>I have more than half dictated the third volume to Mr. Laidlaw; but I
feel the subject wants action, and that a little repose will be very
necessary. Resolve to-morrow shall be a resting-day. I have not had one
this long time. I had a letter from Croker, advising a literary
adventure&mdash;the <a name="Page_395"></a>personal history of Charles Edward.<a name="FNanchor_446_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_450"><sup>[446]</sup></a> I think it will
do. Rode to Melrose and brought home the letters from the post-office.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 8,&mdash;I took leave of poor Major John Scott,<a name="FNanchor_447_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_451"><sup>[447]</sup></a> who, being
afflicted with a distressing asthma, has resolved upon selling his house
in Ravenswood, which he had dressed up with much neatness, and going
abroad to Jamaica. Without having been intimate friends, we were always
affectionate relations, and now we part, probably never to meet in this
world. He has a good deal of the character said to belong to the family.
Our parting with mutual feeling may be easily supposed.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 9.&mdash;This being Saturday, I expect the bibliopolist and
typographer about two o'clock, I suppose, when I shall have much to
journalise. Failures among the trade are alarming, yet not if we act
with prudence. <i>Nous verrons</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Cadell and J. Ballantyne, with the son of the latter. Their courage
is much stouter than I apprehended. Cadell says he has lost &pound;1000 by bad
debts, which is less than he expected, by bad times coming on at this
time. We have been obliged to publish the less popular part of the
Waverley Novels. At present I incline to draw a period after 48 volumes,
and so close the publication. About nine or ten volumes will then
conclude our <i>Magnum Opus</i>, so called, and Mr. Cadell thinks we shall
then begin the Poetical Works, in twelve volumes, with illustrations by
Turner, which he expects to rise as far as 12,000. The size is to be
that of the Waverley Novels.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 10.&mdash;I had a letter from Mr. Cowan, Trustee for</p>

<p><a name="Page_396"></a>Constable's creditors, telling that the manuscripts of the Waverley
Novels had been adjudged to him, and offering them to me, or rather
asking my advice about the disposal of them. Answered that I considered
myself as swindled out of my property, and therefore will give no
consent to any sale of the pillage.<a name="FNanchor_448_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_452"><sup>[448]</sup></a> Cadell says he is determined to
get the MSS. from Cowan. I told him I would give him the rest of the
MSS., which are in my own hand, for Mr. Cadell has been very friendly to
me in not suffering me to want money in difficult times. We are not
pushed by our creditors, so can take our own time; and as our plans
prosper, we can pay off debt. About two o'clock enter two gentlemen in
an open carriage, both from Makerstoun, and both Captains in the Navy.
Captain Blair, a son of the member for Ayrshire, my old friend the Laird
of Blair. Just as they retreat, Mr. Pontey is announced. I was glad to
see this great forester. He is a little man, and gets along with an air
of talent, something like Gifford, the famous editor of the <i>Quarterly</i>.
As in his case mental acuteness gave animation to that species of
countenance which attends personal deformity. The whole of his face was
bizarre and odd, yet singularly impressive. We walked round, I with
great pain, by the Hooded Corbies' seat, and this great Lord of the
woodland gave the plantation great approbation. He seems rather
systematic in pruning, yet he is in a great measure right. He is
tolerably obstinate in his opinions. He dined, leaving me flattered with
his applause, and pleased with having seen him.</p>
<a name="Page_397"></a>
<p><i>April</i> 11.&mdash;This day I went, with Anne and Miss Jane Erskine,<a name="FNanchor_449_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_453"><sup>[449]</sup></a> to
see the laying of the stones of foundation of two bridges in my
neighbourhood over Tweed and the Ettrick. There was a great many people
assembled. The day was beautiful, the scene romantic, and the people in
good spirits and good-humour. Mr. Paterson<a name="FNanchor_450_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_454"><sup>[450]</sup></a> of Galashiels made a
most excellent prayer; Mr. Smith<a name="FNanchor_451_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_455"><sup>[451]</sup></a> gave a proper repast to the
workmen, and we subscribed sovereigns apiece to provide for any
casualty. I laid the foundation-stone of the bridge over Tweed, and Mr.
C.B. Scott<a name="FNanchor_452_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_456"><sup>[452]</sup></a> of Woll that of Ettrick. The general spirit of
good-humour made the scene, though without parade, extremely
interesting.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 12.&mdash;We breakfasted with the Fergusons, after which Anne and
Miss Erskine walked up the Rhymer's Glen. I could as easily have made a
pilgrimage to Rome with pease in my shoes unboiled. I drove home, and
began to work about ten o'clock. At one o'clock I rode, and sent off
what I had finished. Mr. Laidlaw dined with me. In the afternoon we
wrote five or six pages more. I am, I fear, sinking a little, from
having too much space to fill, and a want of the usual inspiration which
makes me, like the chariot wheels of Pharaoh in the sands of the Red
Sea, drive heavily. It is the less matter if this prove, as I suspect,
the last of this fruitful family.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 13.&mdash;Corrected a proof in the morning. At ten <a name="Page_398"></a>o'clock began
where I had left off at my romance. Mr. Laidlaw agrees as to the portion
of what we are presently busy with. Laidlaw begins to smite the rock for
not giving forth the water in quantity sufficient. I remarked to him
that this would not profit much. Doing, perhaps, twelve pages a day will
easily finish us, and if it prove dull, why, dull it must be. I shall,
perhaps, have half a dozen to make up this night. I have against me the
disadvantage of being called the Just, and every one of course is
willing to worry me. But they have been long at it, and even those works
which have been worst received at their appearance now keep their ground
fairly enough. So we'll try our old luck another voyage.</p>

<p>It is a close, thick rain, and I cannot ride, and I am too dead lame to
walk in the house. So, feeling really exhausted, I will try to sleep a
little.</p>

<p>My nap was a very short one, and was agreeably replaced by Basil Hall's
Fragments of Voyages. Everything about the inside of a vessel is
interesting, and my friend has the great sense to know this is the case.
I remember when my eldest brother took the humour of going to sea, James
Watson<a name="FNanchor_453_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_457"><sup>[453]</sup></a> used to be invited to George Square to tell him such tales
of hardships as might disgust him with the service. Such were my poor
mother's instructions. But Captain Watson could not render a sea life
disgusting to the young midshipman or to his brother, who looked on and
listened. The account of assistance given to the Spaniards at Cape
Finisterre, and the absurd behaviour of the Junta, are highly
interesting&mdash;a more inefficient, yet a more resolved class of men than
the Spaniards were never conceived.</p>
<a name="Page_399"></a>
<p><i>April</i> 14.&mdash;Advised by Mr. Cadell that he has agreed with Mr. Turner,
the first draughtsman of the period, to furnish to the poetical works
two decorations to each of the proposed twelve volumes, to wit, a
frontispiece and vignette to each, at the rate of &pound;25 for each, which is
cheap enough considering these are the finest specimens of art going.
The difficulty is to make him come here to take drawings. I have written
to the man of art, inviting him to my house, though, if I remember, he
is not very agreeable, and offered to transport him to the places where
he is to exercise his pencil. His method is to take various drawings of
remarkable places and towns and stick them all together. He can
therefore derive his subjects from good accurate drawings, so with
Skene's assistance we can equip him. We can put him at home on all the
subjects. Lord Meadowbank and his son, Skene and his son, Colonel
Russell and his sister, dined with us.<a name="FNanchor_454_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_458"><sup>[454]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>April</i> 15.&mdash;Lord Meadowbank, etc., went to Newark with me, and returned
to dine with the foregoing. Charming day.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 16.&mdash;Lord Meadowbank went to the circuit and our party to their
various homes. By the bye, John Pringle and his brother of Haining dined
with us yesterday. Skene walks with me and undertakes readily to supply
Turner with subjects. Weather enchanting. About 100 leaves will now
complete <i>Robert of Paris</i>. Query, will it answer? Not knowing, can't
say. I think it will.</p>

<br /><a name="Page_400"></a>

<p><i>Sunday</i> 16<i>th</i> [17<i>th</i>] <i>April to Sunday</i> 24<i>th</i> of the same month
unpleasantly occupied by ill [health], and its consequences, a distinct
shock of paralysis affecting both my nerves and spine, though beginning
only on Monday with a very bad cold. Dr. [Abercrombie] was brought out
by the friendly care of Cadell, but young Clarkson had already done the
needful&mdash;that is, had bled and blistered severely, and placed me on a
very restricted diet. Whether these precautions have been taken in time
I cannot tell. I think they have, though severe in themselves, beat the
disease. But I am alike prepared,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Seu versare dolos, seu cert&aelig; occumbere morti.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_455_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_460"><sup>[455]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I only know that to live as I am just now is a gift little worth having.
I think I will be in the Secret next week unless I recruit greatly.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 27.&mdash;They have cut me off from animal food and fermented liquor
of every kind, and would press upon me such trash as panada and the
like, which affect my stomach.</p>

<p><a name="Page_401"></a>This I will none of, but quietly wait till my ordinary diet is
permitted, and thank God I can fast with any one. I walked out and found
the day delightful; the woods are looking charming, just bursting forth
to the tune of the birds. I have been whistling on my wits like so many
chickens, and cannot miss any of them. I feel, on the whole, better than
I have yet done. I believe I have fined and recovered, and so may be
thankful.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 28 and 29.&mdash;Walter made his appearance, well and stout, and
completely recovered of his stomach complaints by abstinence. He has
youth on his side, and I in age must submit to be a Lazarus. The medical
men persist in recommending a seton. I am no friend to these risky
remedies, and will be sure of the necessity before I yield consent. The
dying like an Indian under torture is no joke, and, as Commodore
Trunnion says, I feel heart-whole as a biscuit. My mind turns to
politics. I feel better just now, and so I am. I will wait till Lockhart
comes, but that may be too late.</p>

<a name="MAY_1831"></a><h2>MAY.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>April</i> 30 <i>and May</i> 1.&mdash;To meet Sandy Pringle to settle the day of
election on Monday. Go on with <i>Count Robert</i> half-a-dozen leaves per
day. I am not much pleased with my handiwork. The Chancery money seems
like to be paid. This will relieve me of poor Charles, who is at present
my chief burthen. The task of pumping my brains becomes inevitably
harder when &quot;both chain-pumps are choked below;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_456_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_461"><sup>[456]</sup></a> and though this
may not be the case literally, yet the apprehension is wellnigh as bad.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 2.&mdash;The day passed as usual in dictating (too little) and riding a
good deal. I must get finished with <i>Count Robert</i>, who is progressing,
as the Transatlantics say, at a very slow pace indeed. By the bye, I
have a letter from Nathan T. Rossiter, Williamstown, New York City,
offering me a collection of poems by Byron, which are said to have been
found in Italy some years since by a friend of Mr. Rossiter. I don't see
I can at all be entitled to these, so shall write to decline them. If
Mr. Rossiter chooses to publish them in Italy or America he may, but,
published here, they must be the property of Lord Byron's executors.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 3.&mdash;Sophia arrives&mdash;with all the children looking well and
beautiful, except poor Johnnie, who looks very pale. But it is no
wonder, poor thing!</p>

<p><i>May</i> 4.&mdash;I have a letter from Lockhart, promising to be down by next
Wednesday, that is, to-day. I will consult him about Byron's Exec., and
as to these poems said to be his Lordship's. They are very probably
first copies <a name="Page_403"></a>thrown aside, or may not be genuine at all. I will be glad
to see Lockhart. My pronunciation is a good deal improved. My time
glides away ill employed, but I am afraid of the palsy. I should not
like to be pinned to my chair. But I believe even that kind of life is
more endurable than we could suppose. Your wishes are limited to your
little circle&mdash;yet the idea is terrible to a man who has been active. My
own circle in bodily matters is daily narrowing; not so in intellectual
matters, but I am perhaps a bad judge. The plough is coming to the end
of the furrow, so it is likely I shall not reach the common goal of
mortal life by a few years. I am now in my sixtieth year only, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Three score and ten years do sum up.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_457_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_462"><sup>[457]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>May</i> 5.&mdash;A fleece of letters, which must be answered, I suppose&mdash;all
from persons, my zealous admirers, of course, and expecting a degree of
generosity, which will put to rights all their maladies, physical and
mental; and expecting that I can put to rights whatever losses have been
their lot, raise them to a desirable rank, and [stand] their protector
and patron. I must, they take it for granted, be astonished at having an
address from a stranger; on the contrary, I would be astonished if any
of these extravagant epistles were from any one who had the least title
to enter into correspondence with me. I have all the plague of answering
these teasing people.</p>

<p>Mr. Burn, the architect, came in, struck by the appearance of my house
from the road. He approved my architecture greatly. He tells me the
edifice for Jeanie Deans&mdash;that is, her prototype&mdash;is nigh finished, so I
must get the inscription ready.<a name="FNanchor_458_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_463"><sup>[458]</sup></a> Mr. Burn came to meet with Pringle
<a name="Page_404"></a>of Haining; but, alas! it is two nights since this poor young man,
driving in from his own lake, where he had been fishing, an ill-broken
horse ran away with him, and, at his own stable-door, overturned the
vehicle and fractured poor Pringle's skull; he died yesterday morning. A
sad business; so young a man, the proprietor of a good estate, and a
well-disposed youth. His politics were, I think, mistaken, being the
reverse of his father's; but that is nothing at such a time. Burn went
on to Richardson's place of<a name="Page_405"></a> Kirklands, where he is to meet the
proprietor, whom I too would wish to see, but I can hardly make it out.
Here is a world of arrangements. I think we will soon hit upon
something. My son Walter takes leave of me to-day to return to
Sheffield. At his entreaty I have agreed to put in a seton, which they
seem all to recommend. My own opinion is, this addition to my tortures
will do me no good; but I cannot hold out against my son. So, when the
present blister is well over, let them try their seton as they call it.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 6 <i>and</i> 7.&mdash;Here is a precious job. I have a formal remonstrance
from these critical persons, Ballantyne and Cadell, against the last
volume of <i>Count Robert</i>, which is within a sheet of being finished. I
suspect their opinion will be found to coincide with that of the public;
at least it is not very different from my own. The blow is a stunning
one I suppose, for I scarcely feel it. It is singular, but it comes with
as little surprise as if I had a remedy ready. Yet God knows, I am at
sea in the dark, and the vessel leaky, I think, into the bargain. I
cannot conceive that I should have tied a knot with my tongue which my
teeth cannot untie. We will see. I am determined to write a political
pamphlet <i>co&ucirc;te que co&ucirc;te</i>; ay,&mdash;should it cost me my life.</p>

<p>I will right and left at these unlucky proof-sheets, and alter at least
what I cannot mend.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 8.&mdash;I have suffered terribly, that is the truth, rather in body
than in mind, and I often wish I could lie down and sleep without
waking. But I will fight it out if I can. It would argue too great an
attachment of consequence to my literary labours to sink under. Did I
know how to begin, I would begin this very day, although I knew I should
sink at the end. After all, this is but fear and faintness of heart,
though of another kind from that which trembleth at a loaded pistol. My
bodily strength is terribly gone; perhaps my mental too?</p>

<p><i>May</i> 9.&mdash;The weather uncommonly beautiful and I am <a name="Page_406"></a>very eager to get
on thinning woods while the peeling season lasts. We made about &pound;200 off
wood last season, and this is a sum worth looking at.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 10.&mdash;Some repairs on the mill-dam still keep the people employed,
and we cannot get to the thinning. Yet I have been urging them for a
month. It's a great fault of Scottish servants that they cannot be
taught to time their turns.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 11.&mdash;By old practice I should be going into town to-day, the Court
sitting to-morrow. Am I happier that I am free from this charge? Perhaps
I am; that is certain, time begins to make my literary labour more
precious than usual. Very weak, scarce able to crawl about without the
pony&mdash;lifted on and off&mdash;and unable to walk half a mile save with great
pain.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 12.&mdash;Resolved to lay by <i>Robert of Paris</i>, and take it up when I
can work. Thinking on it really makes my head swim, and that is not
safe. Miss Ferrier comes out to us. This gifted personage, besides
having great talents, has conversation the least <i>exigeante</i> of any
author, female at least, whom I have ever seen among the long list I
have encountered,&mdash;simple, full of humour, and exceedingly ready at
repartee; and all this without the least affectation of the blue
stocking.<a name="FNanchor_459_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_464"><sup>[459]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>May</i> 13.&mdash;Mr., or more properly Dr., Macintosh Mackay comes out to see
me, a simple learned man, and a Highlander who weighs his own nation
justly&mdash;a modest and estimable person.</p>

<p>I was beat up at midnight to sign a warrant against some delinquents. I
afterwards heard that the officers were pursued by a mob from
Galashiels, with purpose of deforcing them as far as St. Boswell's
Green, but the men were lodged in Jedburgh Castle.</p>
<a name="Page_407"></a>
<p>Reports of mobs at all the elections, which, I fear, will prove too
true. They have much to answer for who in gaiety of heart have brought a
peaceful and virtuous population to such a pass.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 14.&mdash;Rode with Lockhart and Mr. Mackay through the plantations,
and spent a pleasanter day than of late months. Story of a haunted glen
in Laggan:&mdash;A chieftain's daughter or cousin loved a man of low degree.
Her kindred discovered the intrigue and punished the lover's presumption
by binding the unhappy man, and laying him naked in one of the large
ants' nests common in a Highland forest. He died in agony of course, and
his mistress became distracted, roamed wildly in the glen till she died,
and her phantom, finding no repose, haunted it after her death to such a
degree that the people shunned the road by day as well as night. Mrs.
Grant of Laggan tells the story, with the addition, that her husband,
then minister of Laggan, fixed a religious meeting in the place, and, by
the exercise of public worship there, overcame the popular terror of the
Red Woman. Dr. Mackay seems to think that she was rather banished by a
branch of the Parliamentary road running up the glen than by the prayers
of his predecessor. Dr. Mackay, it being Sunday, favoured us with an
excellent discourse on the Socinian controversy, which I wish my friend
Mr. Laidlaw had heard.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 15.&mdash;Dr. M. left us early this morning; and I rode and studied as
usual, working at the <i>Tales of My Grandfather</i>. Our good and learned
Doctor wishes to go down the Tweed to Berwick. It is a laudable
curiosity, and I hope will be agreeably satisfied.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 16 <i>and</i> 17.&mdash;I wrote and rode as usual, and had the pleasure of
Miss Ferrier's company in my family hours, which was a great
satisfaction; she has certainly less affectation than any female I have
known that has stood so high&mdash;Joanna Baillie hardly excepted. By the
way, she [Mrs.<a name="Page_408"></a> Baillie] has entered on the Socinian controversy, for
which I am very sorry; she has published a number of texts on which she
conceives the controversy to rest, but it escapes her that she can only
quote them through a translation. I am sorry this gifted woman is hardly
doing herself justice, and doing what is not required at her hands. Mr.
Laidlaw of course thinks it the finest thing in the world.<a name="FNanchor_460_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_465"><sup>[460]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>May</i> 18.&mdash;Went to Jedburgh to the election, greatly against the wishes
of my daughters. The mob were exceedingly vociferous and brutish, as
they usually are now-a-days. But the Sheriff had two troops of dragoons
at Ancrum Bridge, and all went off quietly. The populace gathered in
formidable numbers&mdash;a thousand from Hawick alone; they were sad
blackguards, and the day passed with much clamour and no mischief. Henry
Scott was re-elected&mdash;for the last time, I suppose. <i>Troja fuit.</i></p>

<p>I left the burgh in the midst of abuse and the gentle hint of &quot;Burke Sir
Walter.&quot; Much obliged to the brave lads of Jeddart. Upwards of forty
freeholders voted for Henry Scott, and only fourteen for the puppy that
opposed him. Even of this party he gained far the greater number by the
very awkward coalition with Sir William Scott of Ancrum. I came home at
seven at night.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 20.&mdash;This is the Selkirk election, which I supposed would be as
tumultuous as the Jedburgh one, but the soutars of Selkirk had got a new
light, and saw in the proposed Reform Bill nothing but a mode of
disfranchising their ancient burgh. Although the crowd was great, yet
there was a sufficient body of special constables, hearty in their
useful office, and the election passed as quietly as I ever <a name="Page_409"></a>witnessed
one. I came home before dinner, very quiet. I am afraid there is
something serious in Galashiels; Jeffrey is fairly funked about it, and
has written letters to the authorities of Roxburghshire and Selkirkshire
to caution us against making the precognitions public, which looks ill.
Yet I think he would have made arrests when the soldiers were in the
country. The time at which I settled at Abbotsford, Whitsunday 1811, I
broke up a conspiracy of the weavers. It will look like sympathising
with any renewal if another takes place just now. Incendiary letters
have been sent, and the householders are in a general state of alarm.
The men at Jedburgh Castle are said to be disposed to make a clean
breast; if so, we shall soon know more of the matter. Lord William
Graham has been nearly murdered at Dumbarton. Why should he not have
brought down 50 or 100 lads with the kilts, each with a good kent<a name="FNanchor_461_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_466"><sup>[461]</sup></a>
in his hand fit to call the soul out of the body of these weavers? They
would have kept order, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 21.&mdash;Little more than my usual work and my usual exercise. I rode
out through the plantations and saw the woodmen getting down what was to
be felled. It seems there will be as much for sale as last year of bark:
I think about &pound;40 worth. A very nice additional pond to the sawmill has
been executed. As for my <i>Tales</i>, they go on well, and are amusing to
myself at least. The History of France is very entertaining.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 22.&mdash;I have a letter from my friend John Thomson of Duddingston. I
had transmitted him an order for the Duke of Buccleuch for his best
picture, at his best price, leaving the choice of the subject and
everything else to himself. He expresses the wish to do, at an ordinary
price, a picture of common size. The declining to put himself forward
will, I fear, be thought like shrinking from his own reputation, which
nobody has less need to do. The Duke <a name="Page_410"></a>may wish a large picture for a
large price for furnishing a large apartment, and the artist should not
shrink from it. I have written him my opinion. The feeling is no doubt
an amiable, though a false one. He is modest in proportion to his
talents. But what brother of the finer arts ever approached [excellence]
so as to please himself?</p>

<p><i>May</i> 23, 24, <i>and</i> 25.&mdash;Worked and exercised regularly. I do not feel
that I care twopence about the change of diet as to taste, but I feel my
strength much decayed. On horseback my spine feels remarkably sore, and
I am tired with a few miles' ride. We expect Walter coming down for the
Fife election.</p>

<blockquote><p>[From May 25th to October 9th there are no dates in the Journal,
     but the entry beginning &quot;I have been very ill&quot; must have been made
     about the middle of September. &quot;In the family circle,&quot; says Mr.
     Lockhart, &quot;he seldom spoke of his illness at all, and when he did,
     it was always in a hopeful strain.&quot; &quot;In private, to Laidlaw and
     myself, his language corresponded exactly with the tone of the
     Diary. He expressed his belief that the chances of recovery were
     few&mdash;very few&mdash;but always added that he considered it his duty to
     exert what faculties remained to him for the sake of his creditors
     to the very last.&mdash;'I am very anxious,' he repeatedly said to me,
     'to be done one way or other with this <i>Count Robert</i>, and a little
     story about the Castle Dangerous&mdash;which also I had long in my
     head&mdash;but after that I will attempt nothing more, at least not
     until I have finished all the notes for the Novels,'&quot; etc.</p>

<p>     On the 18th July he set out in company with Mr. Lockhart to visit
     Douglas Castle, St. Bride's Church and its neighbourhood, for the
     purpose of verifying the scenery of <i>Castle Dangerous</i>, then partly
     printed, returning on the 20th.</p>

<p>     He finished that book and <i>Count Robert</i> before the end of August.</p>

<p>     In September, Mr. Lockhart, then staying at Chiefswood, and
     proposing to make a run into Lanarkshire for a day or two,
     mentioned overnight at Abbotsford that he intended <a name="Page_411"></a>to take his
     second son, then a boy of five or six years of age, and Sir
     Walter's namesake, with him on the stage-coach.</p>

<p>     Next morning the following affectionate billet was put into his
     hands:&mdash;</p>

<p>     To J.G. LOCKHART, Esq., Chiefswood.</p>

<p>     &quot;DEAR DON, or Doctor Giovanni,</p>

<p>     &quot;Can you really be thinking of taking Wa-Wa by the coach&mdash;and I
     think you said outside? Think of Johnny, and be careful of this
     little man. Are you <i>par hazard</i> something in the state of the poor
     capitaine des dragons that comes in singing:&mdash;</p>

<p>     &quot;If so, remember 'Richard's himself again,' and make free use of
     the enclosed cheque on Cadell for &pound;50. He will give you the ready
     as you pass through, and you can pay when I ask.</p>

<p>     &quot;Put horses to your carriage, and go hidalgo fashion. We shall all
     have good days yet.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'And those sad days you deign to spend<br /></span>

<p>     On the 15th September he tells the Duke of Buccleuch, &quot;I am going
     to try whether the air of Naples will make an old fellow of sixty
     young again.&quot;</p>

<p>     On the 17th the old splendour of the house was revived. Col.
     Glencairn Burns, son of the poet, then in Scotland, came</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;To stir with joy the towers of Abbotsford.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>     The neighbours were assembled, and, having his son to help him, Sir
     Walter did the honours of the table once more as of yore.</p>

<p>     On the 19th the poet Wordsworth arrived, and left on the 22d.</p>

<p>     On the 20th, Mrs. Lockhart set out for London to prepare for her

<p>I have been very ill, and if not quite unable to write, I have been
unfit to do so. I have wrought, however, at two Waverley things, but not
well, and, what is worse, past mending. A total prostration of bodily
strength is my chief complaint. I cannot walk half a mile. There is,
besides, some mental confusion, with the extent of which I am not
perhaps fully acquainted. I am perhaps setting. I am myself inclined to
think so, and, like a day that has been admired as a fine one, the light
of it sets down amid mists and storms. I neither regret nor fear the
approach of death if it is coming. I would compound for a little pain
instead of this heartless muddiness of mind which renders me incapable
of anything rational. The expense of my journey will be something
considerable, which I can provide against by borrowing &pound;500 from Mr.
Gibson. To Mr. Cadell I owe already, with the cancels on these
apoplectic books, about &pound;200, and must run it up to &pound;500 more at least;
yet this heavy burthen would be easily borne if I were to be the Walter
Scott I once was; but the change is great. This would be nothing,
providing that I could count on these two books having a sale equal to
their predecessors; but as they do not deserve the same countenance,
they will not and cannot have such a share of favour, and I have only to
hope that they will not involve the <i>Waverley</i>, which are now selling
30,000 volumes a month, in their displeasure. Something of a Journal and
the <i>Reliquiae Trotcosienses</i> will probably be moving articles, and I
have in <a name="Page_413"></a>short no fears in pecuniary matters. The ruin which I fear
involves that of my King and country. Well says Colin Mackenzie:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Shall this desolation strike thy towers alone?<br /></span>
<span>No, fair Ellandonan! such ruin 'twill bring,<br /></span>

<span>And thy fate shall be mixed with the fate of thy King.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_465_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_470"><sup>[465]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I fear that the great part of the memorialists are bartering away the
dignity of their rank by seeking to advance themselves by a job, which
is a melancholy sight. The ties between democrat and aristocrat are
sullen discontent with each other. The former are regarded as a
house-dog which has manifested incipient signs of canine madness, and is
not to be trusted. Walter came down to-day to join our party.</p>

<p>[<i>September</i> 20?]&mdash;Yesterday, Wordsworth, his son [nephew<a name="FNanchor_466_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_471"><sup>[466]</sup></a>] and
daughter, came to see us, and we went up to Yarrow. The eldest son of
Lord Ravensworth also came to see us, with his accomplished lady. We had
a pleasant party, and to-day were left by the Liddells, <i>manent</i> the
three Wordsworths, <i>cum c&aelig;teris</i>, a German or Hungarian Count Erd&ouml;dy, or
some such name.</p>

<p>We arrived in London [September 28,] after a long and painful journey,
the weakness of my limbs palpably increasing, and the physic prescribed
making me weaker every day. Lockhart, poor fellow, is as attentive as
possible, and I have, thank God, no pain whatever; could the end be as
easy it would be too happy. I fancy the instances of Euthanasia are not
very uncommon. Instances there certainly are among the learned and the
unlearned&mdash;Dr.</p>

<p><a name="Page_414"></a>Black, Tom Purdie. I should wish, if it please God, to sleep off in
such a quiet way; but we must take what Fate sends. I have not warm
hopes of being myself again.</p>

<p>Wordsworth and his daughter, a fine girl, were with us on the last day.
I tried to write in her diary, and made an ill-favoured botch&mdash;no help
for it. &quot;Stitches will wear, and ill ones will out,&quot; as the tailor
says.<a name="FNanchor_467_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_472"><sup>[467]</sup></a></p>

<p>[<i>October</i> 8, London.]&mdash;The King has located me on board the <i>Barham</i>,
with my suite, consisting of my eldest son, youngest daughter, and
perhaps my daughter-in-law, which, with poor Charles, will make a goodly
tail. I fancy the head of this tail cuts a poor figure, scarce able to
stir about.</p>

<p>The town is in a foam with politics. The report is that the Lords will
throw out the Bill, and now, morning of 8th October, I learn it is
quoited downstairs like a shovel-board shilling, with a plague to it, as
the most uncalled-for attack upon a free constitution, under which men
lived happily, which ever was ventured in my day. Well, it would have
been pleasing to have had some share in so great a victory, yet even now
I am glad I have been quiet. I believe I should only have made a bad
figure. Well, I will have time enough to think of all this.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 9.&mdash;The report to-day is that the Chancellor<a name="FNanchor_468_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_473"><sup>[468]</sup></a> will unite
with the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel to bring in a Bill of
his own concocting, modified to the taste of the other two, with which
some think they will be satisfied. This is not very unlikely, for Lord
Brougham has been displeased with not having been admitted to Lord John
Russell's task of bill-drawing. He is a man of unbounded ambition, as
well as unbounded talent and [uncertain] temper. There have been hosts
of people here, particularly the Duke of <a name="Page_415"></a>Buccleuch, to ask me to the
christening of his son and heir, when the King stands godfather. I am
asked as an ally and friend of the family, which makes the compliment
greater. Singular that I should have stood godfather to this Duke
himself, representing some great man.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 10.&mdash;Yesterday we dined alone, so I had an opportunity of
speaking seriously to John; but I fear procrastination. It is the cry of
Friar Bacon's Brazen head, <i>time is&mdash;time was</i>; but the time may soon
come&mdash;<i>time shall be no more</i>. The Whigs are not very bold, not much
above a hundred met to support Lord Grey to the last. Their resolutions
are moderate, probably because they could not have carried stronger. I
went to breakfast at Sir Robert Henry Inglis', and coming home about
twelve found the mob rising in the Regent's Park, and roaring for Reform
as rationally as a party of Angusshire cattle would have done.</p>

<p>Sophia seemed to act as the jolly host in the play. &quot;These are my
windows,&quot; and, shutting the shutters, &quot;let them batter&mdash;I care not
serving the good Duke of Norfolk.&quot; After a time they passed out of our
sight, hurrying doubtless to seek a more active scene of reformation. As
the night closed, the citizens who had hitherto contented themselves
with shouting, became more active, and when it grew dark set forth to
make work for the glaziers.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 11, <i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;We set out in the morning to breakfast with
Lady Gifford. We passed several glorious specimens of the last night's
feats of the reformers. The Duke of Newcastle's and Lord Dudley's houses
were sufficiently broken. The maidens, however, had resisted, and from
the top of the house with coals, which had greatly embarrassed the
assembled mob. Surely if the people are determined on using a right so
questionable, and the Government resolved to consider it as too sacred
to be resisted, some modes of resistance might be resorted to of a
character more ludicrous than firearms,&mdash;coals, for example, scalding
oil, <a name="Page_416"></a>boiling water, or some other mode of defence against a sudden
attack. We breakfasted with a very pleasant party at Lady Gifford's. I
was particularly happy to meet Lord Sidmouth; at seventy-five, he tells
me, as much in health and spirits as at sixty. I also met Captain Basil
Hall, to whom I owe so much for promoting my retreat in so easy a
manner. I found my appointment to the <i>Barham</i> had been pointed out by
Captain Henry Duncan, R.N., as being a measure which would be
particularly agreeable to the officers of the service. This is too high
a compliment. In returning I called to see the repairs at Lambeth, which
are proceeding under the able direction of Blore, who met me there. They
are in the best Gothic taste, and executed at the expense of a large
sum, to be secured by way of mortgage, payable in fifty years; each
incumbent within the time paying a proportion of about &pound;4000 a year. I
was pleased to see this splendour of church architecture returning
again.</p>

<p>Lord Mahon, a very amiable as well as a clever young man, comes to
dinner with Mr. Croker; Lady Louisa Stuart in the afternoon, or, more
properly, at night.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 12.&mdash;Misty morning&mdash;looks like a yellow fog, which is the
curse of London. I would hardly take my share of it for a share of its
wealth and its curiosity&mdash;a vile double-distilled fog of the most
intolerable kind. Children scarce stirring yet, but baby and the Macaw
beginning their Macaw notes. Among other feats of the mob on Monday, a
gentleman who saw the onslaught told me two men got on Lord
Londonderry's carriage and struck him; the chief constable came to the
rescue and belaboured the rascals, who ran and roared. I should have
liked to have seen the onslaught&mdash;Dry beating, and plenty of it, is a
great operator of a reform among these gentry. At the same time Lord
Londonderry is a brain-sick man, very unlike his brother. He
horsewhipped a sentinel under arms at Vienna for obeying his <i>consigne</i>,
which was madness. On the other side <a name="Page_417"></a>all seems to be prepared. Heavy
bodies of the police are stationed in all the squares and places
supporting each other regularly. The men themselves say that their
numbers amount to 3000, and that they are supported by troops in still
greater numbers, so that the Conservative force is sufficiently strong.
Four o'clock&mdash;a letter from the Duke saying the party is put off by
command of the King, and probably the day will be put off until the
Duke's return from Scotland, so our hopes of seeing the fine ceremony
are all ended.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 13.&mdash;<i>Nocte pluit tota</i>&mdash;an excellent recipe for a mob, so
they have been quiet accordingly, as we are informed. Two or three other
wet nights would do much to weary them out with inactivity. Milman, whom
I remember a fine gentlemanlike young man, dined here yesterday. He says
the fires have never ceased in his country, but that the oppressions and
sufferings occasioned by the poor's rates are very great, and there is
no persuading the English farmer that an amended system is comfortable
both for rich and poor. The plan of ministers is to keep their places
maugre Peers and Commons both, while they have the countenance of the
crown; but if a Prince shelters, by authority of the prerogative,
ministers against the will of the other authority of the state, does he
not quit the defence which supposes he can do no wrong? This doctrine
would make a curious change of parties. Will they attempt to legitimize
the Fitz Clarences? God forbid! Yet it may end in that,&mdash;it would be
Paris all over. The family is said to have popular qualities. Then what
would be the remedy? Marry! seize on the person of the Princess
Victoria, carrying her north and setting up the banner of England with
the Duke of W. as dictator! Well, I am too old to fight, and therefore
should keep the windy side of the law; besides, I shall be buried before
times come to a decision. In the meantime the King dare not <a name="Page_418"></a>go to stand
godfather to the son of one of his most powerful peers, a party of his
own making, lest his loving subjects pull the house about the ears of
his noble host and the company invited to meet him. Their loyalty has a
pleasant way of displaying itself. I will go to Westminster after
breakfast and see what people are saying, and whether the <i>Barham</i> is
likely to sail, or whether its course is not altered to the coast of the
Low Countries instead of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 14.&mdash;Tried to walk to Lady Louisa Stuart's, but took a little
vertigo and came back. Much disturbed by a letter from Walter. He is
like to be sent on an obnoxious service with very inadequate force,
little prospect of thanks if he does his duty, and much of blame if he
is unable to accomplish it. I have little doubt he will ware his
mother's calf-skin on them.</p>

<p>The manufacturing districts are in great danger. London seems pretty
secure. Sent off the revise of introduction to Mr. Cadell.<a name="FNanchor_469_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_474"><sup>[469]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>October</i> 16.&mdash;A letter from Walter with better news. He has been at
hard-heads with the rogues and come off with advantage; in short,
practised with success the art of drawing two souls out of one
weaver.<a name="FNanchor_470_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_475"><sup>[470]</sup></a> All seems quiet now, and I suppose the Major will get his
leave as proposed. Two ladies&mdash;[one] Byron's Mary Chaworth&mdash;have been
frightened to death while the mob tore the dying creatures from their
beds and proposed to throw them into the flames, drank the wine,
destroyed the furniture, and committed other excesses of a
jacquerie.<a name="FNanchor_471_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_476"><sup>[471]</sup></a> They have been put down, however, by a strong force of
yeomanry and regulars. Walter says the soldiers fired over the people's
heads, whereas if they had levelled low, the bullets must have told more
among the multitude. I cannot approve of this, for in such cases
<a name="Page_419"></a>severity is ultimate mercy.<a name="FNanchor_472_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_477"><sup>[472]</sup></a> However, if they have made a
sufficient impression to be striking&mdash;why, enough is as good as a feast.</p>

<p>There is a strange story about town of ghost-seeing vouched by Lord
Prudhoe, a near relation of the Duke of Northumberland, and whom I know
as an honourable man. A colonel described as a cool-headed sensible man
of worth and honour, Palgrave, who dined with us yesterday, told us
twice over the story as vouched by Lord Prudhoe, and Lockhart gave us
Colonel Felix's edition, which coincided exactly. I will endeavour to
extract the essence of both. While at Grand Cairo they were attracted by
the report of a physician who could do the most singular magical feats,
and was in the habit not only of relieving the living, but calling up
the dead. This sage was the member of a tribe in the interior part of
Africa. They were some time (two years) in finding him out, for he by no
means pressed himself on the curious, nor did he on the other hand avoid
them; but when he came to Grand Cairo readily agreed to gratify them by
a sight of his wonders. The scenes exhibited were not visible to the
operator himself, nor to the person for whose satisfaction they were
called up, but, as in the case of Dr. Dee and other adepts, by means of
a viewer, an ignorant Nubian boy, whom, to prevent imposition, the
English gentlemen selected for the purpose, and, as they thought,
without any risk of imposture by confederacy betwixt him and the
physician. The process was as follows:&mdash;A black square was drawn in the
palm of the boy's hand, or rather a kind of pentacle with an Arabic
character inscribed at each angle. The figures evoked were seen through
this space as if the substance of the hand had been removed. Magic
rites, and particularly perfumes, were liberally <a name="Page_420"></a>resorted to. After
some fumigation the magician declared that they could not proceed until
the seven flags should become visible. The boy declared he saw nothing,
then said he saw a flag, then two; often hesitated at the number for a
certain time, and on several occasions the spell did not work and the
operation went no further, but in general the boy saw the seven flags
through the aperture in his hand. The magician then said they must call
the Sultan, and the boy said he saw a splendid tent fixed, surrounded by
immense hosts, Eblis no doubt, and his angels. The person evoked was
then named, and appeared accordingly. The only indispensable requisite
was that he was named speedily, for the Sultan did not like to be kept
waiting. Accordingly, William Shakespeare being named, the boy declared
that he saw a Frank in a dress which he described as that of the reign
of Elizabeth or her successor, having a singular countenance, a high
forehead, and a very little beard. Another time a brother of the Colonel
was named. The boy said he saw a Frank in his uniform dress and a black
groom behind him leading a superb horse. The dress was a red jacket and
white pantaloons; and the principal figure turning round, the boy
announced that he wanted his arm, as was the case with Felix's brother.
The ceremony was repeated fourteen times; successfully in twelve
instances, and in two it failed from non-appearance of the seven banners
in the first instance. The apparent frankness of the operator was not
the least surprising part of the affair. He made no mystery, said he
possessed this power by inheritance, as a family gift; yet that he could
teach it, and was willing to do so, for no enormous sum&mdash;nay, one which
seemed very moderate. I think two gentlemen embraced the offer. One of
them is dead and the other still abroad. The sage also took a price for
the exhibition of his skill, but it was a moderate one, being regulated
by the extent of the perfumes consumed in the ceremony.</p><a name="Page_421"></a>

<p>There remains much more to ask I understood the witnesses do not like to
bother about, which is very natural. One would like to know a little
more of the Sultan, of the care taken to secure the fidelity of the boy
who was the viewer and on whom so much depended; whether another sage
practising the same feat, as it was said to be hereditary, was ever
known to practise in the city. The truth of a story irreconcilable with
the common course of nature must depend on cross-examination. If we
should find, while at Malta, that we had an opportunity of expiscating
this matter, though at the expense of a voyage to Alexandria, it would
hardly deter me.<a name="FNanchor_473_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_478"><sup>[473]</sup></a> The girls go to the Chapel Royal this morning at
St. James's. A visit from the Honourable John Forbes, son of my old and
early friend Lord Forbes, who is our fellow-passenger. The ship expects
presently to go to sea. I was very glad to see this young <a name="Page_422"></a>officer and
to hear his news. Drummond and I have been Mends from our infancy.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 17.&mdash;The morning beautiful. To-day I go to look after the
transcripts in the Museum and have a card to see a set of chessmen<a name="FNanchor_474_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_479"><sup>[474]</sup></a>
thrown up by the sea on the coast of Scotland, which were offered to
sale for &pound;100. The King, Queen, Knights, etc., were in the costume of
the 14th century, the substance ivory or rather the tusk of the morse,
somewhat injured by the salt water in which they had been immersed for
some time.</p>

<p>Sir John Malcolm told us a story about Garrick and his wife. The lady
admired her husband greatly, but blamed him for a taste for low life,
and insisted that he loved better to play Scrub to a low-lifed audience
than one of his superior characters before an audience of taste. On one
particular occasion she was in her box in the theatre. <i>Richard III</i>.
was the performance, and Garrick's acting, especially in the night
scene, drew down universal applause. After the play was over Mrs. G.
proposed going home, which Garrick declined, alleging he had some
business in the green-room, which must detain him. In short, the lady
was obliged to acquiesce, and wait the beginning of a new entertainment,
in which was introduced a farmer giving his neighbours an account of the
wonders seen on a visit to London. This character was received with such
peals of applause that Mrs. Garrick began to think it rivalled those
which had been so lately lavished on Richard the Third. At last she
observed her little spaniel dog was making efforts to get towards the
balcony which separated <a name="Page_423"></a>him from the facetious farmer. Then she became
aware of the truth. &quot;How strange,&quot; she said, &quot;that a dog should know his
master, and a woman, in the same circumstances, should not recognise her
husband!&quot;</p>

<p><i>October 18</i>.&mdash;Sophia had a small but lively party last night, as indeed
she has had every night since we were here&mdash;Ladies&mdash;[Lady Stafford,]
Lady Louisa Stuart, Lady Montagu, Miss Montagu, Lady [Davy], [Mrs.]
Macleod, and two or three others; Gentlemen&mdash;Lord Montagu, Macleod, Lord
Dudley, Rogers [Mackintosh]. A good deal of singing. If Sophia keeps to
early hours she may beat London for small parties as poor Miss White
did, and without much expense. A little address is all that is
necessary. Sir John<a name="FNanchor_475_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_480"><sup>[475]</sup></a> insists on my meeting this Rammohun Roy;<a name="FNanchor_476_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_481"><sup>[476]</sup></a> I
am no believer in his wandering knight, so far. The time is gone of
sages who travelled to collect wisdom as well as heroes to reap honour.
Men think and fight for money. I won't see the man if I can help it.
Flatterers are difficult enough to keep at a distance though they be no
renegades. I hate a fellow who begins with throwing away his own
religion, and then affects a prodigious respect for another.</p>

<p><i>October 19</i>.&mdash;Captain H. Duncan called with Captain Pigot, a
smart-looking gentlemanlike man, and announces his purpose of sailing on
Monday. I have made my preparations for being on board on Sunday, which
is the day appointed. Captain Duncan told me jocularly never to take a
naval captain's word on shore, and quoted Sir William Scott, who used to
say, waggishly, that there was nothing so <a name="Page_424"></a>accommodating as a naval
captain on shore; but when on board he became a peremptory lion. Henry
Duncan has behaved very kindly, and says he only discharges the wishes
of his service in making me as easy as possible, which is very handsome.
No danger of feud, except about politics, which would be impolite on my
part, and though it bars out one great subject of discourse, it leaves
enough besides. That I might have nothing doubtful, Walter arrives with
his wife, ready to sail, so what little remains must be done without
loss of time. This is our last morning, so I have money to draw for and
pay away. To see our dear Lord Montagu too. The Duchess came yesterday.
I suppose &pound;50 will clear me, with some balance for Gibraltar.</p>

<p>I leave this country uncertain if it has got a total pardon or only a
reprieve. I won't think of it, as I can do no good. It seems to be in
one of those crises by which Providence reduces nations to their
original elements.<a name="FNanchor_477_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_482"><sup>[477]</sup></a> If I had my health, I should take no worldly
fee, not to be in the bustle; but I am as weak as water, and I shall be
glad when I have put the Mediterranean between the island and me.</p>

<p><i>October 21 and 22</i>.&mdash;Spent in taking of farewell and adieus, which had
been put off till now. A melancholy ceremonial, with some a useless one;
yet there are friends whom it sincerely touches one to part with. It is
the cement of life giving way in a moment. Another unpleasant
circumstance is&mdash;one is called upon to recollect those whom death or
estrangement has severed, after starting merrily together in the voyage
of life.</p>

<p><i>October 23</i>.&mdash;Portsmouth; arrived here in the evening. <a name="Page_425"></a>Found the
<i>Barham</i> will not sail till 26th October, that is Wednesday next. The
girls break loose, mad with the craze of seeing sights, and run the risk
of our losing some of our things and deranging the naval officers, who
offer their services with their natural gallantry. Captain Pigot came to
breakfast, with several other officials. The girls contrived to secure a
sight of the Block manufactory, together with that of the Biscuit, also
invented by Brunel. I think that I have seen the first of these
wonderful [sights] in 1816, or about that time.<a name="FNanchor_478_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_483"><sup>[478]</sup></a> Sir Thomas Foley
gives an entertainment to the Admiralty, and sends to invite [me]; but I
pleaded health, and remained at home. Neither will I go out
sight-seeing, which madness seems to have seized my womankind. This
ancient town is one of the few in England which is fortified, and which
gives it a peculiar appearance. It is much surrounded with heaths or
thin poor muirs covered with heather, very barren, yet capable of being
converted into rich arable and pasturage. I would [not] desire a better
estate than to have 2000 acres which would be worth 40 shillings an
acre.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 24.&mdash;My womankind are gone out with Walter and Captain Hall. I
wish they would be moderate in their demands on people's complaisance.
They little know how inconvenient are such seizures. A sailor is in
particular a bad refuser, and before he can turn three times round, he
is bound with a triple knot to all kinds of [engagements]. The wind is
west, that is to say contrary, so our sailing on the day after to-morrow
is highly doubtful.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 25.&mdash;A gloomy October day, the wind inflexibly constant in the
west, which is fatal. Sir James Graham proposes to wait upon us after
breakfast. A trouble occurs about my taking an oath before a
master-extraordinary in Chancery; but such cannot easily be found, as
they reside <a name="Page_426"></a>in chambers in town, and rusticate after business, so they
are difficult to catch as an eel. At ten my children set off to the
dockyard, which is a most prodigious effort of machinery, and they are
promised the sight of an anchor in the act of being forged, a most
cyclopean sight. Walter is to call upon the solicitor and appoint him to
be with [me] by twelve.</p>

<p>About the reign of Henry VIII. the French took the pile, as it was
called, of&mdash;&mdash;,<a name="FNanchor_479_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_484"><sup>[479]</sup></a> but were beat off. About the end of the American
war, an individual named John Aitken, or John the Painter, undertook to
set the dockyard on fire, and in some degree accomplished his purpose.
He had no accomplice, and to support himself committed solitary
robberies. Being discovered, he long hung in chains near the outward
fortifications. Last night a deputation of the Literary and
Philosophical Society of [Portsmouth] came to present me with the
honorary freedom of their body, which I accepted with becoming
gratitude. There is little credit in gathering the name of a disabled
invalid. Here I am, going a long and curious tour without ability to
walk a quarter of a mile; quere, what hope of recovery? I think and
think in vain, when attempting to trace the progress of this disease and
so gradually has my health declined, that I believe it has been acting
upon me for ten years, gradually diminishing my strength. My mental
faculties may perhaps recover; my bodily strength cannot return unless
climate has an effect on the human frame which I cannot possibly believe
or comprehend. The safe resolution is, to try no foolish experiments,
but make myself as easy as I can, without suffering myself to be vexed
about what I cannot help. If I sit on the deck and look at Vesuvius, it
will be all I ought to think of.</p>

<p>Having mentioned John the Painter, I may add that it was in this town of
Portsmouth that the Duke of Buckingham was stabbed to death by Felton, a
fanatic of the same <a name="Page_427"></a>kind with the Incendiary, though perpetrator of a
more manly crime. This monster-breeding age can afford both Feltons and
John Aitkens in abundance. Every village supplies them, while in fact a
deep feeling of the coarsest selfishness furnishes the ruling motive,
instead of an affectation of public spirit&mdash;that hackneyed affectation
of patriotism, as like the reality as a Birmingham halfpenny to a
guinea.</p>

<p>The girls, I regret to see, have got a senseless custom of talking
politics in all weathers and in all sorts of company. This can do no
good, and may give much offence. Silence can offend no one, and there
are pleasanter or less irritating subjects to talk of. I gave them both
a hint of this, and bid them both remember they were among ordinary
strangers. How little young people reflect what they may win or lose by
a smart reflection imprudently fired off at a venture!</p>

<p>Mr. Barrow of the Admiralty came and told us the whole fleet, <i>Barham</i>
excepted, were ordered to the North Sea to help to bully the King of
Holland, and that Captain Pigot, whose motions are of more importance to
us than those of the whole British Navy, sails, as certainly as these
things can be prophesied, on Thursday, 27th October.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 26.&mdash;Here we still are, fixed by the inexorable wind.
Yesterday we asked a few old friends, Mr. and Mrs. Osborne, and two or
three others, to tea and talk. I engaged in a new novel, by Mr.
Smith,<a name="FNanchor_480_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_485"><sup>[480]</sup></a> called <i>New Forest</i>. It is written in an old style,
calculated to meet the popular ideas&mdash;somewhat like &quot;Man as he is
not&quot;<a name="FNanchor_481_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_486"><sup>[481]</sup></a> and that class. The author's opinions seem rather to sit loose
upon him and to be adopted for the nonce and not very well brought out.
His idea of a hero is an American philosopher with all the affected
virtues of a Republican which no man believes in.</p>

<p>This is very tiresome&mdash;not to be able to walk abroad for <a name="Page_428"></a>an instant,
but to be kept in this old house which they call &quot;The Fountain,&quot; a
mansion made of wood in imitation of a ship. The timbers were well tried
last night during the squall. The barometer has sunk an inch very
suddenly, which seems to argue a change, and probably a deliverance from
port. Sir Michael Seymour, Mr. Harris, Captain Lawrence came to greet us
after breakfast; also Sir James Graham. They were all learned on this
change of weather which seems to be generally expected. I had a good
mess of Tory chat with Mr. Harris. We hope to see his daughters in the
evening. He keeps his courage amid the despair of too many of his party.
About one o'clock our Kofle, as Mungo Park words it, set out, self
excluded, to witness the fleet sailing from the ramparts.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 27.&mdash;The weather is more moderate and there is a chance of our
sailing. We whiled away our time as we could, relieved by several kind
visits. We realised the sense of hopeless expectation described by
Fielding in his Voyage to Lisbon, which identical tract Captain Hall,
who in his eagerness to be kind seems in possession of the wishing-cap
of Fortunatus, was able to provide for us. To-morrow is spoken of as
certainly a day to move.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 28.&mdash;But the wind is as unfavourable as ever and I take a
hobbling morning walk upon the rampart, where I am edified by a
good-natured officer who shows me the place, marked by a buoy, where the
<i>Royal George</i> went down &quot;with twice four hundred men.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_482_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_487"><sup>[482]</sup></a> Its hull
forms a shoal which is still in existence, a neglect scarcely
reconcilable with the splendour of our proceedings where our navy is
concerned. Saw a battle on the rampart between two sailor boys, who
fought like game-cocks. Returned to &quot;The Fountain,&quot; to a voluminous
breakfast. Captain Pigot calls, with little hope of sailing to-day. I
made my civil affidavit yesterday to a master extraordinary in Chancery,
which I gave to Sophia last night.</p>
<a name="Page_429"></a>
<p><i>October</i> 29 (The <i>Barham</i>).&mdash;The weather is changed and I think we
shall sail. Captain Forbes comes with offer of the Admiral Sir Michael
Seymour's barge, but we must pause on our answer. I have had a very
disturbed night. Captain Pigot's summons is at length brought by his own
announcement, and the same time the Admiral's barge attends for our
accommodation and puts us and our baggage on board the <i>Barham</i>, a
beautiful ship, a 74 cut down to a 50, and well deserving all the
commendations bestowed on her. The weather a calm which is almost equal
to a favourable wind, so we glide beautifully along by the Isle of Wight
and the outside of the island. We landsfolk feel these queerish
sensations, when, without being in the least sick, we are not quite
well. We dine enormously and take our cot at nine o'clock, when we sleep
undisturbed till seven.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 30.&mdash;Find the Bill of Portland in sight, having run about
forty miles during the night. About the middle of the day turn sea-sick
and retire to my berth for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 31.&mdash;A sleepless night and a bilious morning, yet not so very
uncomfortable as the phrase may imply. The bolts clashed, and made me
dream of poor Bran. The wind being nearly completely contrary, we have
by ten o'clock gained Plymouth and of course will stand westward for
Cape Finisterre; terrible tossing and much sea-sickness, beating our
passage against the turn. I may as well say we had a parting visit from
Lady Graham, who came off in a steamer, saluted us in the distance and
gave us by signal her &quot;bon voyage.&quot; On Sunday we had prayers and Service
from Mr. Marshall, our Chaplain, a Trinity College youth, who made a
very respectable figure.</p><a name="Page_430"></a>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="NOVEMBER_1831"></a><h2>NOVEMBER.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>November</i> 1.&mdash;The night was less dismal than yesterday, and we hold our
course, though with an unfavourable wind, and make, it is said, about
forty miles progress. After all, this sort of navigation recommends the
steamer, which forces its way whether the breeze will or no.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 2.&mdash;Wind as cross as two sticks, with nasty squalls of wind
and rain. We keep dodging about the Lizard and Land's End without ever
getting out of sight of these interesting terminations of Old England.
Keep the deck the whole day though bitter cold. Betake myself to my
berth at nine, though it is liker to my coffin.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 3.&mdash;Sea-sickness has pretty much left us, but the nights are
far from voluptuous, as Lord Stowell says. After breakfast I established
myself in the after-cabin to read and write as well as I can, whereof
this is a bad specimen.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 4.&mdash;The current unfavourable, and the ship pitching a great
deal; yet the vessel on the whole keeps her course, and we get on our
way with hope of reaching Cape Finisterre when it shall please God.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 5.&mdash;We still creep on this petty pace from day to day without
being able to make way, but also without losing any. Meanwhile,
<i>Fr&ouml;hlich!</i> we become freed from the nausea and disgust of the
sea-sickness and are chirruping merrily. Spend the daylight chiefly on
deck, where the sailors are trained in exercising the great guns on a
new sort of carriage called, from the inventor, Marshall's, which seems
ingenious.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 6.&mdash;No progress to-day; the ship begins to lay her course but
makes no great way. Appetite of the passengers excellent, which we amuse
at the expense of the <a name="Page_431"></a>sea stock. Cold beef and biscuit. I feel myself
very helpless on board, but everybody is ready to assist me.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 7.&mdash;The wind still holds fair, though far from blowing
steadily, but by fits and variably. No object to look at&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;One wide water all around us,<br /></span>
<span>All above us one 'grey' sky.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_483_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_488"><sup>[483]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are neither birds in the air, fish in the sea, nor objects on face
of the waters. It is odd that though once so great a smoker I now never
think on a cigar; so much the better.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 8.&mdash;As we begin to get southward we feel a milder and more
pleasing temperature, and the wind becomes decidedly favourable when we
have nearly traversed the famous Bay of Biscay. We now get into a sort
of trade wind blowing from the East.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 9.&mdash;This morning run seventy miles from twelve at night. This
is something like going. Till now, bating the rolling and pitching, we
lay</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;... as idle as a painted ship<br /></span>
<span>Upon a painted ocean.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>November</i> 10.&mdash;Wind changes and is both mild and favourable. We pass
Cape Ortegal, see a wild cluster of skerries or naked rocks called
Berlingas rising out of the sea like M'Leod's Maidens off the Isle of
Skye.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 11.&mdash;Wind still more moderate and fair, yet it is about
eleven knots an hour. We pass Oporto and Lisbon in the night. See the
coast of Portugal: a bare wild country, with here and there a church or
convent. If it keeps fair this evening we [make] Gibraltar, which would
be very desirable. Our sailors have been exercised at a species of sword
exercise, which recalls many recollections.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 12.&mdash;The favourable wind gets back to its quarters in the
south-west, and becomes what the Italians call the Sirocco, abominated
for its debilitating qualities. I <a name="Page_432"></a>cannot say I feel them, but I dreamt
dreary dreams all night, which are probably to be imputed to the
Sirocco. After all, it is not an uncomfortable wind to a Caledonian wild
and stern. Ink won't serve.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 13.&mdash;The wind continues unaccommodating all night, and we see
nothing, although we promised ourselves to have seen Gibraltar, or at
least Tangiers, this morning, but we are disappointed of both. Tangiers
reminded me of my old Antiquarian friend Auriol Hay Drummond, who is
Consul there.<a name="FNanchor_484_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_489"><sup>[484]</sup></a> Certainly if a human voice could have made its hail
heard through a league or two of contending wind and wave, it must have
been Auriol Drummond's. I remember him at a dinner given by some of his
friends when he left Edinburgh, where he discharged a noble part &quot;self
pulling like Captain Crowe 'for dear life, for dear life' against the
whole boat's crew,&quot; speaking, that is, against 30 members of a drunken
company and maintaining the predominance. Mons Meg was at that time his
idol. He had a sort of avarice of proper names, and, besides half a
dozen which were his legitimately, he had a claim to be called
<i>Garvadh</i>, which uncouth appellation he claimed on no very good
authority to be the ancient name of the Hays&mdash;a tale. I loved him
dearly; he had high spirits, a zealous faith, good-humour, and
enthusiasm, and it grieves me that I must pass within ten miles of him
and leave him unsaluted; for mercy-a-ged what a yell of gratitude would
there be! I would put up with a good rough gale which would force us
into Tangiers and keep us there for a week, but the wind is only in
gentle opposition, like a well-drilled spouse. Gibraltar we shall see
this evening, Tangiers becomes out of the question. Captain says we will
lie by during the night, sooner than darkness shall devour such an
object of curiosity, so we must look sharp for the old rock.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 14.&mdash;The horizon is this morning full of re<a name="Page_433"></a>membrances. Cape
St. Vincent, Cape Spartel, Tarifa, Trafalgar&mdash;all spirit-stirring
sounds, are within our ken, and recognised with enthusiasm both by the
old sailors whose memory can reinvest them with their terrors, and by
the naval neophytes who hope to emulate the deeds of their fathers. Even
a non-combatant like myself feels his heart beat faster and fuller,
though it is only with the feeling of the unworthy boast of the
substance in the fable, <i>nos poma natamus</i>.</p>

<p>I begin to ask myself, Do I feel any symptoms of getting better from the
climate?&mdash;which is delicious,&mdash;and I cannot reply with the least
consciousness of certainty; I cannot in reason expect it should be
otherwise: the failure of my limbs has been gradual, and it cannot be
expected that an infirmity which at least a year's bad weather gradually
brought on should diminish before a few mild and serene days, but I
think there is some change to the better; I certainly write easier and
my spirits are better. The officers compliment me on this, and I think
justly. The difficulty will be to abstain from working hard, but we will
try. I wrote to Mr. Cadell to-day, and will send my letter ashore to be
put into Gibraltar with the officer who leaves us at that garrison. In
the evening we saw the celebrated fortress, which we had heard of all
our lives, and which there is no possibility of describing well in
words, though the idea I had formed of it from prints, panoramas, and so
forth, proved not very inaccurate. Gibraltar, then, is a peninsula
having a tremendous precipice on the Spanish side&mdash;that is, upon the
north, where it is united to the mainland by a low slip of land called
the neutral ground. The fortifications which rise on the rock are
innumerable, and support each other in a manner accounted a model of
modern art; the northern face of the rock itself is hewn into tremendous
subterranean batteries called the hall of Saint George, and so forth,
mounted with guns of a large calibre. But I have heard it would be
difficult to use them, from the effect of the report on the
artillery<a name="Page_434"></a>men. The west side of the fortress is not so precipitous as
the north, and it is on this it has been usually assailed. It bristles
with guns and batteries, and has at its northern extremity the town of
Gibraltar, which seems from the sea a thriving place, and from thence
declines gradually to Cape Europa, where there is a great number of
remains of old caverns and towers, formerly the habitation or refuge of
the Moors. At a distance, and curving into a bay, lie Algeciras, and the
little Spanish town of Saint Roque, where the Spanish lines were planted
during the siege.<a name="FNanchor_485_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_490"><sup>[485]</sup></a> From Europa Point the eastern frontier of
Gibraltar runs pretty close to the sea, and arises in a perpendicular
face, and it is called the back of the rock. No thought could be
entertained of attacking it, although every means were used to make the
assault as general as possible. The efforts sustained by such
extraordinary means as the floating batteries were entirely directed
against the defences on the west side, which, if they could have been
continued for a few days with the same fury with which they commenced,
must have worn out the force of the garrison. The assault had continued
for several hours without success on either side, when a private man of
the artillery, his eye on the floating batteries, suddenly called with
ecstasy, &quot;She burns, by G&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;;<a name="FNanchor_486_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_491"><sup>[486]</sup></a> and first that vessel and then
others were visibly discovered to be on fire, and the besiegers' game
was decidedly up.</p>

<p>We stood into the Bay of Gibraltar and approached the harbour firing a
gun and hoisting a signal for a boat: one accordingly came off&mdash;a
man-of-war's boat&mdash;but refused to have any communication with us on
account of the quar<a name="Page_435"></a>antine, so we can send no letters ashore, and after
some pourparlers, Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, instead of joining his regiment, must
remain on board. We learned an unpleasant piece of news. There has been
a tumult at Bristol and some rioters shot, it is said fifty or sixty. I
would flatter myself that this is rather good news, since it seems to be
no part of a formed insurrection, but an accidental scuffle in which the
mob have had the worst, and which, like Tranent, Manchester, and
Bonnymoor, have always had the effect of quieting the people and
alarming men of property.<a name="FNanchor_487_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_492"><sup>[487]</sup></a> The Whigs will find it impossible to
permit men to be plundered by a few blackguards called by them the
people, and education and property probably will recover an ascendency
which they have only lost by faintheartedness.</p>

<p>We backed out of the Bay by means of a current to the eastward, which
always runs thence, admiring in our retreat the lighting up the windows
in the town and the various barracks or country seats visible on the
rock. Far as we are from home, the general lighting up of the windows in
the evening reminds us we are still in merry old England, where in
reverse of its ancient law of the curfew, almost every individual,
however humble his station, takes as of right a part of the evening for
enlarging the scope of his industry or of his little pleasures. He trims
his lamp to finish at leisure some part of his task, which seems in such
circumstances almost voluntary, while his wife prepares the little meal
which is to be its legitimate reward. But this happy privilege of
English freemen has ceased. One happiness it is, they will soon learn
their error.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 15.&mdash;I had so much to say about Gibraltar that I omitted all
mention of the Strait, and more distant <a name="Page_436"></a>shores of Spain and Barbary,
which form the extreme of our present horizon; they are highly
interesting. A chain of distant mountains sweep round Gibraltar, bold
peaked, well defined, and deeply indented; the most distinguishable
points occasionally garnished with an old watch-tower to afford
protection against a corsair. The mountains seemed like those of the
first formation, liker, in other words, to the Highlands than those of
the South of Scotland. The chains of hills in Barbary are of the same
character, but more lofty and much more distant, being, I conceive, a
part of the celebrated ridge of Atlas.</p>

<p>Gibraltar is one of the pillars of Hercules, Ceuta on the Moorish side
is well known to be the other; to the westward of a small fortress
garrisoned by the Spaniards is the Hill of Apes, the corresponding
pillar to Gibraltar. There is an extravagant tradition that there was
once a passage under the sea from the one fortress to the other, and
that an adventurous governor, who puzzled his way to Ceuta and back
again, left his gold watch as a prize to him who had the courage to go
to seek it.</p>

<p>We are soon carried by the joint influence of breeze and current to the
African side of the straits, and coast nearly along a wild shore formed
of mountains, like those of Spain, of varied form and outline. No
churches, no villages, no marks of human hand are seen. The chain of
hills show a mockery of cultivation, but it is only wild heath
intermingled with patches of barren sand. I look in vain for cattle or
flocks of sheep, and Anne as vainly entertains hopes of seeing lions and
tigers on a walk to the sea-shore. The land of this wild country seems
to have hardly a name. The Cape which we are doubling has one,
however&mdash;the Cape of the Three Points. That we might not be totally
disappointed we saw one or two men engaged apparently in ploughing,
distinguished by their turbans and the long pikes which they carried.
Dr. Liddell says that on former <a name="Page_437"></a>occasions he has seen flocks and
shepherds, but the war with France has probably laid the country waste.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 16.&mdash;When I waked about seven found that we had the town of
Oran twelve or fourteen miles off astern. It is a large place on the
sea-beach, near the bottom of a bay, built close and packed together as
Moorish [towns], from Fez to Timbuctoo, usually are. A considerable hill
runs behind the town, which seems capable of holding 10,000 inhabitants.
The hill up to its eastern summit is secured by three distinct lines of
fortification, made probably by the Spanish when Oran was in their
possession; latterly it belonged to the State of Algiers; but whether it
has yielded to the French or not we have no means of knowing. A French
schooner of eighteen guns seems to blockade the harbour. We show our
colours, and she displays hers, and then resumes her cruise, looking as
if she resumed her blockade. This would infer that the place is not yet
in French hands. However, we have in any event no business with Oran,
whether African or French. Bristol is a more important subject of
consideration, but I cannot learn there are papers on board. One or two
other towns we saw on this dreary coast, otherwise nothing but a hilly
coast covered with shingle and gum cistus.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 17.&mdash;In the morning we are off Algiers, of which Captain
Pigot's complaisance afforded a very satisfactory sight. It is built on
a sloping hill, running down to the sea, and on the water side is
extremely strong; a very strong mole or causeway enlarges the harbour,
by enabling them to include a little rocky island, and mount immense
batteries, with guns of great number and size. It is a wonder, in the
opinion of all judges, that Lord Exmouth's fleet was not altogether cut
to pieces. The place is of little strength to the land; a high turreted
wall of the old fashion is its best defence. When Charles V. attacked
Algiers, he landed in the bay to the east of the town, and marched
behind it.<a name="Page_438"></a> He afterwards reached what is still called the Emperor's
fort, a building more highly situated than any part of the town, and
commanding the wall which surrounds it. The Moors did not destroy this.
When Bourmont landed with the French, unlike Charles V., that general
disembarked to the westward of Algiers, and at the mouth of a small
river; he then marched into the interior, and, fetching a circuit,
presented himself on the northern side of the town. Here the Moors had
laid a simple stratagem for the destruction of the invading army. The
natives had conceived they would rush at once to the fort of the
Emperor, which they therefore mined, and expected to destroy a number of
the enemy by its explosion. This obvious device of war was easily
avoided, and General Bourmont, in possession of the heights, from which
Algiers is commanded, had no difficulty in making himself master of the
place. The French are said now to hold their conquests with difficulty,
owing to a general commotion among the Moorish chiefs, of whom the Bey
was the nominal sovereign. To make war on these wild tribes would be to
incur the disaster of the Emperor Julian; to neglect their aggressions
is scarcely possible.</p>

<p>Algiers has at first an air of diminutiveness inferior to its fame in
ancient and modern times. It rises up from the shore like a wedge,
composed of a large mass of close-packed white houses, piled as thick on
each other as they can stand; white-terraced roofs, and without windows,
so the number of its inhabitants must be immense, in comparison to the
ground the buildings occupy&mdash;not less, perhaps, than 30,000 men. Even
from the distance we view it, the place has a singular Oriental look,
very dear to the imagination. The country around Algiers is [of] the
same hilly description with the ground on which the town is situated&mdash;a
bold hilly tract. The shores of the bay are studded with villas, and
exhibit enclosures: some used for agriculture, some for gardens, one for
a mosque, with a cemetery around it. It is <a name="Page_439"></a>said they are extremely
fertile; the first example we have seen of the exuberance of the African
soil. The villas, we are told, belong to the Consular Establishment. We
saw our own, who, if at home, put no remembrance upon us. Like the
Cambridge Professor and the elephant, &quot;We were a paltry beast,&quot; and he
would not see us, though we drew within cannon [shot], and our fifty
36-pounders might have attracted some attention. The Moors showed their
old cruelty on a late occasion. The crews of two foreign vessels having
fallen into their hands by shipwreck, they murdered two-thirds of them
in cold blood. There are reports of a large body of French cavalry
having shown itself without the town. It is also reported by Lieutenant
Walker,<a name="FNanchor_488_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_493"><sup>[488]</sup></a> that the Consul hoisted, <i>comme de raison</i>, a British flag
at his country house, so our vanity is safe.</p>

<p>We leave Algiers and run along the same kind of heathy, cliffy, barren
reach of hills, terminating in high lines of serrated ridges, and scarce
showing an atom of cultivation, but where the mouth of a river or a
sheltering bay has encouraged the Moors to some species of
fortification.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 18.&mdash;Still we are gliding along the coast of Africa, with a
steady and unruffled gale; the weather delicious. Talk of an island of
wild goats, by name Golita; this species of deer-park is free to every
one for shooting upon&mdash;belongs probably to the Algerines or Tunisians,
whom circumstances do not permit to be very scrupulous in asserting
their right of dominion; but Dr. Liddell has himself been present at a
grand <i>chasse</i> of the goats, so the thing is true.</p>

<p>The wild sinuosities of the land make us each moment look to see a body
of Arabian cavalry wheel at full gallop out of one of these valleys,
scour along the beach, and disappear up some other recess of the hills.
In fact we see a few herds, but a red cow is the most formidable monster
we have seen.</p>
<a name="Page_440"></a>
<p>A general day of exercise on board, as well great guns as small arms. It
was very entertaining to see the men take to their quarters with the
unanimity of an individual. The marines shot a target to pieces, the
boarders scoured away to take their position on the yards with cutlass
and pistol. The exhibition continued two hours, and was loud enough to
have alarmed the shores, where the Algerines might, if they had thought
fit, have imputed the firing to an opportune quarrel between the French
and British, and have shouted &quot;Allah Kerim&quot;&mdash;God is merciful! This was
the Dey's remark when he heard that Charles X. was dethroned by the
Parisians.</p>

<p>We are near an African Cape called Bugiaroni, where, in the last war,
the Toulon fleet used to trade for cattle.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 19.&mdash;Wind favourable during night, dies away in the morning,
and blows in flurries rather contrary. The steamboat packet, which left
Portsmouth at the same time with us, passes us about seven o'clock, and
will reach a day or two before us. We are now off the coast of Tunis:
not so high and rocky as that of Algiers, and apparently much more
richly cultivated. A space of considerable length along shore, between a
conical hill called Mount Baluty and Cape Bon, which we passed last
night, is occupied by the French as a coral fishery. They drop heavy
shot by lines on the coral rocks and break off fragments which they fish
up with nets. The Algerines, seizing about 200 Neapolitans thus employed
gave rise to the bombardment of their town by Lord Exmouth. All this
coast is picturesquely covered with enclosures and buildings and is now
clothed with squally weather. One hill has a smoky umbrella displayed
over its peak, which is very like a volcano&mdash;many islets and rocks
bearing the Italian names of sisters, brothers, dogs, and suchlike
epithets. The view is very striking, with varying rays of light and of
shade mingling and changing as the wind rises and falls. About one
o'clock we pass the situa<a name="Page_441"></a>tion of ancient Carthage, but saw no ruins,
though such are said to exist. A good deal of talk about two ancient
lakes called&mdash;&mdash;; I knew the name, but little more. We passed in the
evening two rocky islands, or skerries, rising straight out of the
water, called Gli Fratelli or The Brothers.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 20.&mdash;A fair wind all night, running at the merry rate of nine
knots an hour. In the morning we are in sight of the highest island,
Pantellaria, which the Sicilians use as a state prison, a species of
Botany Bay. We are about thirty miles from the burning island&mdash;I mean
Graham's&mdash;but neither that nor Etna make their terrors visible. At noon
Graham's Island appears, greatly diminished since last accounts. We got
out the boats and surveyed this new production of the earth with great
interest. Think I have got enough to make a letter to our Royal Society
and friends at Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_489_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_494"><sup>[489]</sup></a> Lat. 37&deg; 10' 31&quot; N., long. 12&deg; 40' 15&quot;
E., lying north and south by compass, by Mr. Bokely, the Captain's
clerk['s measurements]. Returned on board at dinner-time.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 21.&mdash;Indifferent night. In the morning we are running off
Gozo, a subordinate island to Malta, intersected with innumerable
enclosures of dry-stone dykes similar to those used in Selkirkshire, and
this likeness is increased by the appearance of sundry square towers of
ancient days. In former times this was believed to be Calypso's island,
and the cave of the enchantress is still shown. We saw the entrance from
the deck, as rude a cavern as ever opened out of a granite rock. The
place of St. Paul's shipwreck is also shown, no doubt on similarly
respectable authority.</p>

<p>At last we opened Malta, an island, or rather a city, like no other in
the world. The seaport, formerly the famous Valetta, comes down to the
sea-shore. On the one side lay the [Knights], on the other side lay the
Turks, who finally got entire possession of it, while the other branch
remained in the <a name="Page_442"></a>power of the Christians. Mutual cruelties were
exercised; the Turks, seizing on the survivors of the knights who had so
long defended St. Elmo, cut the Maltese cross on the bodies of the
slain, and, tying them to planks, let them drift with the receding tide
into the other branch of the harbour still defended by the Christians.
The Grand-Master, in resentment of this cruelty, caused his Turkish
prisoners to be decapitated and their heads thrown from mortars into the
camp of the infidels.<a name="FNanchor_490_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_495"><sup>[490]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>November</i> 22.&mdash;To-day we entered Malta harbour, to quarantine, which is
here very strict. We are condemned by the Board of Quarantine to ten
days' imprisonment or sequestration, and go in the <i>Barham's</i> boat to
our place of confinement, built by a Grand-Master named Manuel<a name="FNanchor_491_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_496"><sup>[491]</sup></a> for
a palace for himself and his retinue. It is spacious and splendid, but
not comfortable; the rooms connected one with another by an arcade, into
which they all open, and which forms a delightful walk. If I was to live
here a sufficient time I think I could fit the apartments up so as to be
handsome, and even imposing, but at present they are only kept as
barracks for the infirmary or lazaretto. A great number of friends come
to see me, who are not allowed to approach nearer than a yard. This, as
the whole affair is a farce, is ridiculous enough. We are guarded by the
officers of health in a peculiar sort of livery or uniform with yellow
neck, who stroll up and down with every man that stirs&mdash;and so mend the
matter.<a name="FNanchor_492_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_497"><sup>[492]</sup></a> My friends Captain and <a name="Page_443"></a>Mrs. Dawson, the daughter and
son-in-law of the late Lord Kinnedder, occupying as military quarters
one end of the Manuel palace, have chosen to remain, though thereby
subjected to quarantine, and so become our fellows in captivity. Our
good friend Captain Pigot, hearing some exaggerated report of our being
uncomfortably situated, came himself in his barge with the purpose of
reclaiming his passengers rather than we should be subjected to the
least inconvenience. We returned our cordial thanks, but felt we had
already troubled him sufficiently. We dine with Captain and Mrs. Dawson,
sleep in our new quarters, and, notwithstanding mosquito curtains and
iron bedsteads, are sorely annoyed by vermin, the only real hardship we
have to complain of since the tossing on the Bay of Biscay, and which
nothing could save us from.</p>

<p>Les Maltois ne se mariaient jamais dans le mois de mai. Ils esp&eacute;r&egrave;rent
si mal des ouvrages de tout genre commenc&eacute; durant son cours qu'ils ne se
faisaient pas couper d'habits pendant ce mois.</p>

<p>The same superstition still prevails in Scotland.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 23.&mdash;This is a splendid town. The sea penetrates it in
several places with creeks formed into harbours, surrounded by
buildings, and these again covered with fortifications. The streets are
of very unequal height, and as there has been no attempt at lowering
them, the greatest variety takes place between them; and the singularity
of the various buildings, leaning on each other in such a bold,
picturesque, and uncommon manner, suggests to me ideas for finishing
Abbotsford by a screen on the west side of the old barn and with a
fanciful wall decorated with towers, to enclose the bleaching
green&mdash;watch-towers such as these, of which I can get drawings while I
am here. Employed the forenoon in writing to Lockhart. I am a little at
a loss what account to give of myself. Better I am decidedly in spirit,
but rather hampered by <a name="Page_444"></a>my companions, who are neither desirous to
follow my amusements, nor anxious that I should adopt theirs. I am
getting on with this Siege of Malta very well. I think if I continue, it
will be ready in a very short time, and I will get the opinion of
others, and if my charm hold I will be able to get home through
Italy&mdash;and take up my own trade again.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 24.&mdash;We took the quarantine boat and visited the outer
harbour or great port, in which the ships repose when free from their
captivity. The British ships of war are there,&mdash;a formidable spectacle,
as they all carry guns of great weight. If they go up the Levant as
reported, they are a formidable weight in the bucket. I was sensible
while looking at them of the truth of Cooper's description of the beauty
of their build, their tapering rigging and masts, and how magnificent it
looks as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Hulking and vast the gallant warship rides!&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We had some pride in looking at the <i>Barham</i>, once in a particular
manner our own abode. Captain Pigot and some of his officers dined with
us at our house of captivity. By a special grace our abode here is to be
shortened one day, so we leave on Monday first, which is an indulgence.
To-day we again visit Dragut's Point. The guardians who attend to take
care that we quarantines do not kill the people whom we meet, tell some
stories of this famous corsair, but I scarce can follow their Arabic. I
must learn it, though, for the death of Dragut<a name="FNanchor_493_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_498"><sup>[493]</sup></a> would be a fine
subject for a poem, but in the meantime I will proceed with my
<i>Knights</i>.</p>

<p>[<i>November</i> 25-30.]<a name="FNanchor_494_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_499"><sup>[494]</sup></a>&mdash;By permission of the quarantine board we were
set at liberty, and lost no time in quitting the <a name="Page_445"></a>dreary fort of Don
Manuel, with all its mosquitoes and its thousands of lizards which
[stand] shaking their heads at you like their brother in the new Arabian
tale of <i>Daft Jock</i>. My son and daughter are already much tired of the
imprisonment. I myself cared less about it, but it is unpleasant to be
thought so very unclean and capable of poisoning a whole city. We took
our guardians' boat and again made a round of the harbour; were met by
Mrs. Bathurst's<a name="FNanchor_495_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_500"><sup>[495]</sup></a> carriage, and carried to my very excellent
apartment at Beverley's Hotel. In passing I saw something of the city,
and very comical it was; but more of that hereafter. At or about four
o'clock we went to our old habitation the <i>Barham</i>, having promised
again to dine in the Ward room, where we had a most handsome dinner, and
were dismissed at half-past six, after having the pleasure to receive
and give a couple hours of satisfaction. I took the boat from the chair,
and was a little afraid of the activity of my assistants, but it all
went off capitally; went to Beverley's and bed in quiet.</p>

<p>At two o'clock Mrs. Col. Bathurst transported me to see the Metropolitan
Church of St. John, by far the most magnificent place I ever saw in my
life; its huge and ample vaults are of the Gothic order. The floor is of
marble, each stone containing the inscription of some ancient knight
adorned with a patent of mortality and an inscription recording his name
and family. For instance, one knight I believe had died in the infidels'
prison; to mark his fate, one stone amid the many-coloured pavement
represents a door composed of grates (iron grates I mean), displaying
behind them an interior which a skeleton is in vain attempting to escape
from by bursting the bars. If you conceive he has pined in his fetters
there for centuries till dried in the ghastly image of death himself, it
is a fearful imagination. The roof which bends over this scene of death
is splendidly adorned with carving and gilding, while the varied colours
<a name="Page_446"></a>and tinctures both above and beneath, free from the tinselly effect
which might have been apprehended, [acquire a] solemnity in the dim
religious light, which they probably owe to the lapse of time. Besides
the main aisle, which occupies the centre, there is added a
chapter-house in which the knights were wont to hold their meetings. At
the upper end of this chapter-house is the fine Martyrdom of St. John
the Baptist, by Caravaggio, though this has been disputed. On the left
hand of the body of the church lie a series of subordinate aisles or
chapels, built by the devotion of the different languages,<a name="FNanchor_496_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_501"><sup>[496]</sup></a> and
where some of the worthies inhabit the vaults beneath. The other side of
the church is occupied in the same manner; one chapel in which the
Communion was imparted is splendidly adorned by a row of silver pillars,
which divided the worshippers from the priest. Immense riches had been
taken from this chapel of the Holy Sacrament by the French; a golden
lamp of great size, and ornaments to the value of 50,000 crowns are
mentioned in particular; the rich railing had not escaped the soldiers'
rapacity had it not been painted to resemble wood. I must visit this
magnificent church another time. To-day I have done it at the imminent
risk of a bad fall. We drove out to see a Maltese village, highly
ornamented in the usual taste. Mrs. Bathurst was so good as to take me
in her carriage. We dined with Colonel Bathurst.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 26.&mdash;I visited my old and much respected friend, Mr. John
Hookham Frere,<a name="FNanchor_497_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_502"><sup>[497]</sup></a> and was much gratified to <a name="Page_447"></a>see him the same man I
had always known him,&mdash;perhaps a little indolent; but that's not much. A
good Tory as ever, when the love of many is waxed cold. At night a grand
ball in honour of your humble servant&mdash;about four hundred gentlemen and
ladies. The former mostly British officers of army, navy, and civil
service. Of the ladies, the island furnished a fair proportion&mdash;- I mean
viewed in either way. I was introduced to a mad Italian improvisatore,
who was with difficulty prevented from reciting a poem in praise of the
King, and imposing a crown upon my head, <i>nolens volens</i>. Some of the
officers, easily conceiving how disagreeable this must have been to a
quiet man, got me out of the scrape, and I got home about midnight; but
remain unpoetised and unspeeched.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 28.&mdash;I have made some minutes, some observations, and could
do something at my Siege; but I do not find my health gaining ground. I
visited Frere at Sant' Antonio: a beautiful place with a splendid
garden, which Mr. Frere will never tire of, unless some of his family
come to carry him home by force.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 29.&mdash;Lady Hotham was kind enough to take me a drive, and we
dined with them&mdash;a very pleasant party. I picked up some anecdotes of
the latter siege.</p>

<p>Make another pilgrimage, escorted by Captain Pigot and several of his
officers. We took a more accurate view of this splendid structure
[Church of St. John]. I went down into the vaults and made a visiting
acquaintance with La Valette,<a name="FNanchor_498_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_503"><sup>[498]</sup></a> whom, greatly to my joy, I found most
splendidly provided with a superb sepulchre of bronze, on which he
reclines in the full armour of a Knight of Chivalrie.</p>
<a name="Page_448"></a>

<a name="DECEMBER_1831"></a><h2>DECEMBER</h2>
<br />

<p><i>December</i> 1.&mdash;There are two good libraries, on a different plan and for
different purposes&mdash;a modern subscription library that lends its own
books, and an ancient foreign library which belonged to the Knights, but
does not lend books. Its value is considerable, but the funds
unfortunately are shamefully small; I may do this last some good. I have
got in a present from Frere the prints of the Siege of Malta, very
difficult to understand, and on loan from Mr. Murray, Agent of the Navy
Office, the original of Boiardo, to be returned through Mr. Murray,
Albemarle Street. Mr. Murray is very good-natured about it.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 2.&mdash;My chief occupation has been driving with Frere. Dr.
Liddell declines a handsome fee. I will want to send some oranges to the
children. I am to go with Col. Bathurst to-day as far as to wait on the
bishop. My old friend Sir John Stoddart's daughter is to be married to a
Captain Atkinson. Rode with Frere. Much recitation.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 6.&mdash;Captain Pigot inclines to take me on with him to Naples,
after which he goes to Tunis on Government service. This is an offer not
to be despised, though at the expense of protracting the news from
Scotland, which I engage to provide for in case of the worst, by
offering Mr. Cadell a new romance, to be called The Siege of Malta,
which if times be as they were when I came off, should be thankful[ly
received] at a round sum, paying back not only what is overdrawn, but
supplying finances during the winter.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 10, [<i>Naples</i>].&mdash;I ought to say that before leaving Malta I
went to wait on the Archbishop: a fine old gentle<a name="Page_449"></a>man, very handsome,
and one of the priests who commanded the Maltese in their insurrection
against the French. I took the freedom to hint that as he had possessed
a journal of this blockade, it was but due to his country and himself to
give it to the public, and offered my assistance. He listened to my
suggestion, and seemed pleased with the proposal, which I repeated more
than once, and apparently with success. Next day the Bishop returned my
visit in full state, attended by his clergy, and superbly dressed in
costume, the pearls being very fine. (The name of this fine old
dignitary of the Romish Church is Don Francis Caruana, Bishop of Malta.)</p>

<p>The last night we were at Malta we experienced a rude shock of an
earthquake, which alarmed me, though I did not know what it was. It was
said to foretell that the ocean, which had given birth to Graham's
Island, had, like Pelops, devoured its own offspring, and we are told it
is not now visible, and will be, perhaps, hid from those who risk the
main; but as we did not come near its latitude we cannot say from our
own knowledge that the news is true. I found my old friend Frere as fond
as ever of old ballads. He took me out almost every day, and favoured me
with recitations of the Cid and the continuation of Whistlecraft. He
also acquainted me that he had made up to Mr. Coleridge the pension of
&pound;200 from the Board of Literature<a name="FNanchor_499_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_504"><sup>[499]</sup></a> out of his own fortune.</p>
<a name="Page_450"></a>
<p><i>December</i> 13, [<i>Naples</i>].&mdash;We left Malta on this day, and after a most
picturesque voyage between the coast of Sicily and Malta arrived here on
the 17th, where we were detained for quarantine, whence we were not
dismissed till the day before Christmas. I saw Charles, to my great joy,
and agreed to dine with his master, Right Hon. Mr. Hill,<a name="FNanchor_500_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_505"><sup>[500]</sup></a> resolving
it should be my first and last engagement at Naples. Next morning much
struck with the beauty of the Bay of Naples. It is insisted that my
arrival has been a signal for the greatest eruption from Vesuvius which
that mountain has favoured us with for many a day. I can only say, as
the Frenchman said of the comet supposed to foretell his own death,
&quot;<i>Ah, messieurs, la com&egrave;te me fait trop d'honneur</i>.&quot; Of letters I can
hear nothing. There are many English here, of most of whom I have some
knowledge.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 25, [<i>Bay of Naples</i>].&mdash;We are once more fairly put into
quarantine. Captain Pigot does not, I think, quite understand the
freedom his flag is treated with, and could he find law for so doing
would try his long thirty-six pounders on the town of Naples and its
castles; not to mention a sloop of ten guns which has ostentatiously
entered the Bay to assist them. Lord knows we would make ducks and
drakes of the whole party with the <i>Barham's</i> terrible battery!</p>

<p>There is a new year like to begin and no news from Britain. By and by I
will be in the condition of those who are sick and in prison, and
entitled to visits and consolation on principles of Christianity.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 26, [<i>Strada Nuova</i>].&mdash;Went ashore; admitted to pratique, and
were received here.<a name="FNanchor_501_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_506"><sup>[501]</sup></a> Walter has some money left, which we must use
or try a begging-box, for I see no other resource, since they seem to
have abandoned me so. Go ashore each day to sight-seeing. Have the
pleasure to <a name="Page_451"></a>meet Mr.<a name="FNanchor_502_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_507"><sup>[502]</sup></a> and Mrs. Laing-Meason of Lindertis, and have
their advice and assistance and company in our wanderings almost every
day. Mr. Meason has made some valuable remarks on the lava where the
villas of the middle ages are founded: the lava shows at least upon the
ancient maritime villas of the Romans; so the boot of the moderns galls
the kibe of the age preceding them; the reason seems to be the very
great durability with which the Romans finished their domestic
architecture of maritime arches, by which they admitted the sea into
their lower houses.<a name="FNanchor_503_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_508"><sup>[503]</sup></a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We were run away with, into the grotto very nearly, but luckily stopped
before we entered, and so saved our lives. We have seen the Strada
Nuova&mdash;a new access of extreme beauty which the Italians owe to Murat.</p>

<p>The Bay of Naples is one of the finest things I ever saw. Vesuvius
controls it on the opposite side of the town.</p>

<p>I never go out in the evening, but take airings in the day-time almost
daily. The day after Christmas I went to see some old parts of the city,
amongst the rest a tower called Torre del Carmine, which figured during
the Duke of Guise's adventure, and the gallery of as old a church, where
Masaniello was shot at the conclusion of his career.<a name="FNanchor_504_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_509"><sup>[504]</sup></a> I marked down
the epitaph of a former Empress,<a name="FNanchor_505_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_510"><sup>[505]</sup></a> which is striking and affecting.
It would furnish matter for my Tour if I wanted it.</p>

<p>So is King Alphonso made to sum up the praises of this princely town,
with the losses which he had sustained in making himself master of it. I
looked on it with something of the same feelings, and I may adopt the
same train of thought when I recall Lady Northampton, Lady Abercorn, and
other friends much beloved who have met their death in or near this
city.</p>

<br />

<p><i>January 5</i>.&mdash;Went by invitation to wait upon a priest, who almost
rivals my fighting bishop of Malta. He is the old Bishop of
Tarentum,<a name="FNanchor_507_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_512"><sup>[507]</sup></a> and, notwithstanding his age, eighty and upwards, is
still a most interesting man. A face formed to express an interest in
whatever passes; caressing manners, and a total absence of that rigid
stiffness which hardens the heart of the old and converts them into a
sort of petrifaction. Apparently his foible was a fondness for cats; one
of them, a superb brindled Persian cat, is a great beauty, and seems a
particular favourite. I think we would have got on well together if he
could have spoken English, or I French or Latin; but <i>h&eacute;las!</i> I once saw
at Lord Yarmouth's house a Persian cat, but not quite so fine as that of
the Bishop. He gave me a Latin devotional poem and an engraving of
himself, and I came home about two o'clock.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 6 to 12.&mdash;We reach the 12th January, amusing ourselves as we
can, generally seeing company and taking airings in the forenoon in this
fine country. Sir William Gell, a very pleasant man, one of my chief
cicerones. Lord Hertford comes to Naples. I am glad to keep up an old
acquaintance made in the days of George IV.</p>

<p><a name="Page_456"></a>He has got a breed from Maida, of which I gave him a puppy. There was a
great crowd at the Palazzo, which all persons attended, being the King's
birthday. The apartments are magnificent, and the various kinds of
persons who came to pay court were splendid. I went with the boys as
Brigadier-General of the Archers' Guard, wore a very decent green
uniform, laced at the cuffs, and pantaloons, and looked as well as sixty
could make it out when sworded and feathered <i>comme il faut</i>. I passed
well enough. Very much afraid of a fall on the slippery floor, but
escaped that disgrace. The ceremony was very long. I was introduced to
many distinguished persons, and, but for the want of language, got on
well enough. The King spoke to me about five minutes, of which I hardly
understood five words. I answered him in a speech of the same length,
and I'll be bound equally unintelligible. We made the general key-tone
of the harangue <i>la belle langue et le beau ciel</i> of <i>sa majest&eacute;</i>. Very
fine dresses, very many diamonds....</p>

<p>A pretty Spanish ambassadress, Countess da Costa, and her husband. Saw
the Countess de Lebzeltern, who has made our acquaintance, and seems to
be very clever. I will endeavour to see her again. Introduced to another
Russian Countess of the diplomacy. Got from Court about two o'clock. I
should have mentioned that I had a letter from Skene<a name="FNanchor_508_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_513"><sup>[508]</sup></a> and one from
Cadell, dated as far back as 2d December, a monstrous time ago, [which]
yet puts a period <a name="Page_457"></a>to my anxiety. I have written to Cadell for
particulars and supplies, and, besides, have written a great many pages
of the Siege of Malta, which I think will succeed.</p>

<p>[<i>January</i> 16-23].&mdash;I think &pound;200 a month, or thereby, will do very well,
and it is no great advance.</p>

<p>Another piece of intelligence was certainly to be expected, but now it
has come afflicts us much. Poor Johnny Lockhart! The boy is gone whom we
have made so much of. I could not have borne it better than I now do,
and I might have borne it much worse.<a name="FNanchor_509_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_514"><sup>[509]</sup></a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I went one evening to the Opera to see that amusement in its birthplace,
which is now so widely received over Europe. The Opera House is superb,
but can seldom be quite full. On this night, however, it was; the
guards, citizens, and all persons dependent on the Court, or having
anything to win or lose by it, are expected to take places liberally,
and applaud with spirit. The King bowed much on entrance, and was
received in a popular manner, which he has no doubt deserved, having
relaxed many of his father's violent persecutions against the Liberals,
made in some degree an amnesty, and employed many of this character. He
has made efforts to lessen his expenses; but then he deals in military
affairs, and that swallows up his savings, and Heaven only knows whether
he will bring [Neapolitans] to fight, which the Martinet system alone
will never do. His health is undermined by epileptic fits, which, with
his great corpulence, make men throw their thoughts on his brother
Prince Charles. It is a pity. The King is only two-and-twenty years old.</p>

<p>The Opera bustled off without any remarkable music, and, so far as I
understand the language, no poetry; and except the <i>coup d'&#339;il,</i> which
was magnificent, it was poor work. It was on the subject of Constantine
and Crispus&mdash;<a name="Page_458"></a>marvellous good matter, I assure you. I came home at
half-past nine, without waiting the ballet, but I was dog-sick of the
whole of it. Went to the Studij to-day. I had no answer to my memorial
to the Minister of the Interior, which it seems is necessary to make any
copies from the old romances. I find it is an affair of State, and
Monsieur &mdash;&mdash;- can only hope it will be granted in two or three
days;&mdash;to a man that may leave Naples to-morrow! He offers me a loan of
what books I need, Annals included, but this is also a delay of two or
three days. I think really the Italian men of letters do not know the
use of time made by those of other places, but I must have patience. In
the course of my return home I called, by advice of my <i>valet de place</i>,
at a bookseller's, where he said all the great messieurs went for books.
It had very little the air of a place of such resort, being kept in a
garret above a coach-house. Here some twenty or thirty odd volumes were
produced by an old woman, but nothing that was mercantile, so I left
them for Lorenzo's learned friends. And yet I was sorry too, for the
lady who showed them to me was very [civil], and, understanding that I
was the famous Chevalier, carried her kindness as far as I could desire.
The Italians understand nothing of being in a hurry, but perhaps it is
their way.<a name="FNanchor_510_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_515"><sup>[510]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>January</i> 24.&mdash;The King grants the favour asked. To be perfect I should
have the books [out] of the room, but this seems to [hurt?] Monsieur
Delicteriis as he, kind and civil as he is, would hardly [allow] me to
take my labours out of the Studij, where there are hosts of idlers and
echoes and askers and no understanders of askers. I progress, however,
as the <a name="Page_459"></a>Americans say. I have found that Sir William Gell's amanuensis
is at present disengaged, and that he is quite the man for copying the
romances, which is a plain black letter of 1377, at the cheap and easy
rate of 3 <i>quattrons</i> a day. I am ashamed at the lowness of the
remuneration, but it will dine him capitally, with a share of a bottle
of wine, or, by 'r lady, a whole one if he likes it; and thrice the sum
would hardly do that in England. But we dawdle, and that there is no
avoiding. I have found another object in the Studij&mdash;the language of
Naples.</p>

<p><i>Jany</i>. 2[5?].&mdash;One work in this dialect, for such it is, was described
to me as a history of ancient Neapolitan legends&mdash;<i>quite in my way</i>; and
it proves to be a dumpy fat 12mo edition of Mother Goose's Tales,<a name="FNanchor_511_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_516"><sup>[511]</sup></a>
with my old friends Puss in Boots, Bluebeard, and almost the whole stock
of this very collection. If this be the original of this charming book,
it is very curious, for it shows the right of Naples to the authorship,
but there are French editions very early also;&mdash;for there are
two&mdash;whether French or Italian, I am uncertain&mdash;of different dates, both
having claims to the original edition, each omitting some tales which
the other has.</p>

<p>To what common original we are to refer them the Lord knows. I will look
into [this] very closely, and if this same copiator is worth his ears he
can help me. My friend Mr. D. will aid me, but I doubt he hardly likes
my familiarity with the department of letters in which he has such an
extensive and valuable charge. Yet he is very kind and civil, and
promises me the loan of a Neapolitan vocabulary, which will set me up
for the attack upon Mother Goose. Spirit of Tom Thumb assist me! I
could, I think, make a neat thing of this, obnoxious to ridicule
perhaps;&mdash;what then! The author of <i>Ma S&#339;ur Anne</i> was a clever man, and
his tale will remain popular in spite of all gibes and flouts soever. So
<i>Vamos Caracci</i>! If it was not for the trifling and <a name="Page_460"></a>dawdling peculiar
to this country, I should have time enough, but their trifling with time
is the devil. I will try to engage Mr. Gell in two researches in his way
and more in mine, namely, the Andrea Ferrara and the Bonnet piece.<a name="FNanchor_512_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_517"><sup>[512]</sup></a>
Mr. Keppel Craven says Andrea de Ferraras<a name="FNanchor_513_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_518"><sup>[513]</sup></a> are frequent in Italy.
Plenty to do if we had alert assistance, but Gell and Laing Meason have
both their own matters to puzzle out, and why should they mind my
affairs? The weather is very cold, and I am the reverse of the idiot
boy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;For as my body's growing worse,<br /></span>
<span>My mind is growing better.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_514_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_519"><sup>[514]</sup></a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of this I am distinctly sensible, and thank God that the mist attending
this whoreson apoplexy is wearing off.</p>

<p>I went to the Studij and copied Bevis of Hampton, about two pages, for a
pattern. From thence to Sir William Gell, and made an appointment at the
Studij with his writer to-morrow at ten, when, I trust, I shall find
Delicteriis there, but the gentleman with the classical name is rather
kind and friendly in his neighbour's behalf.<a name="FNanchor_515_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_520"><sup>[515]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>January</i> 26.&mdash;This day arrived (for the first time indeed) answer to
last post end of December, an epistle from Cadell full of good
tidings.<a name="FNanchor_516_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_521"><sup>[516]</sup></a> <i>Castle Dangerous</i> and <i>Sir Robert of Paris</i>, neither of
whom I deemed seaworthy, have performed <a name="Page_461"></a>two voyages&mdash;that is, each sold
about 3400, and the same of the current year. It proves what I have
thought almost impossible, that I might write myself [out], but as yet
my spell holds fast.</p>

<p>I have besides two or three good things on which I may advance with
spirit, and with palmy hopes on the part of Cadell and myself. He thinks
he will soon cry <i>victoria</i> on the bet about his hat. He was to get a
new one when I had paid off all my debts. I can hardly, now that I am
assured all is well again, form an idea to myself that I could think it
was otherwise.</p>

<p>And yet I think it is the public that are mad for passing those two
volumes; but I will not be the first to cry them down in the market, for
I have others in hand, which, judged with equal favour, will make
fortunes of themselves. Let me see what I have on the stocks&mdash;</p>

<br />

<p><i>February</i> 10.&mdash;We went to Pompeii to-day: a large party, all disposed
to enjoy the sight in this fine weather. We had Sir Frederick and Lady
Adam, Sir William Gell, the coryph&aelig;us of our party, who played his part
very well. Miss de la Ferronays,<a name="FNanchor_518_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_523"><sup>[518]</sup></a> daughter of Monsieur le Duc de la
Ferronays, the head, I believe, of the constitutional Royalists, very
popular in France, and likely to be called back to the ministry, with
two or three other ladies, particularly Mrs. Ashley, born Miss
Baillie,<a name="FNanchor_519_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_524"><sup>[519]</sup></a> very pretty indeed, and lives in the same house. The
Countess de la Ferronays has a great deal of talent both musical and
dramatic.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 16.&mdash;Sir William Gell called and took me out to-night to a
bookseller whose stock was worth looking over.</p>

<p>We saw, among the old buildings of the city, an ancient palace called
the Vicar&iacute;a, which is changed into a prison. Then a new palace was
honoured with royal residence instead of the old dungeon. I saw also a
fine arch called the Capuan gate, formerly one of the city towers, and a
very pretty one. We advanced to see the ruins of a palace said to be a
habitation of Queen Joan, and where she put her lovers to death chiefly
by potions, thence into a well, smothering them, etc., and other little
tenderly trifling matters of gallantry.</p>
<a name="Page_463"></a>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="MARCH_1832"></a><h2>MARCH.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>March</i>.&mdash;Embarked on an excursion to Paestum, with Sir William Gell and
Mr. Laing-Meason, in order to see the fine ruins. We went out by
Pompeii, which we had visited before, and which fully maintains its
character as one of the most striking pieces of antiquity, where the
furniture treasure and household are preserved in the excavated houses,
just as found by the labourers appointed by Government. The inside of
the apartments is adorned with curious paintings, if I may call them
such, in mosaic. A meeting between Darius and Alexander is remarkably
fine.<a name="FNanchor_520_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_525"><sup>[520]</sup></a> A street, called the street of Tombs, reaches a considerable
way out of the city, having been flanked by tombs on each side as the
law directed. The entrance into the town affords an interesting picture
of the private life of the Romans. We came next to the vestiges of
Herculaneum, which is destroyed like Pompeii but by the lava or molten
stone, which cannot be removed, whereas the tufa or volcanic ashes can
be with ease removed from Pompeii, which it has filled up lightly. After
having refreshed in a cottage in the desolate town, we proceed on our
journey eastward, flanked by one set of heights stretching from
Vesuvius, and forming a prolongation of that famous mountain. Another
chain of mountains <a name="Page_464"></a>seems to intersect our course in an opposite
direction and descends upon the town of Castellamare. Different from the
range of heights which is prolonged from Vesuvius, this second, which
runs to Castellamare, is entirely composed of granite, and, as is always
the case with mountains of this formation, betrays no trace of volcanic
agency. Its range was indeed broken and split up into specimens of rocks
of most romantic appearance and great variety, displaying granite rock
as the principal part of its composition. The country on which these
hills border is remarkable for its powers of vegetation, and produces
vast groves of vine, elm, chestnut, and similar trees, which grow when
stuck in by cuttings. The vines produce Lacryma Christi in great
quantities&mdash;not a bad wine, though the stranger requires to be used to
it. The sea-shore of the Bay of Naples forms the boundary on the right
of the country through which our journey lies, and we continue to
approach to the granite chain of eminences which stretch before us, as
if to bar our passage.</p>

<p>As we advanced to meet the great barrier of cliffs, a feature becomes
opposed to us of a very pronounced character, which seems qualified to
interrupt our progress. A road leading straight across the branch of
hills is carried up the steepest part of the mountain, ascending by a
succession of zig-zags, which the French laid by scale straight up the
hill. The tower is situated upon an artificial eminence, worked to a
point and placed in a defensible position between two hills about the
same height, the access to which the defenders of the pass could
effectually prohibit.</p>

<p>Sir William Gell, whose knowledge of the antiquities of this country is
extremely remarkable, acquainted us with the history.</p>

<p>In the middle ages the pasturages on the slope of these hills,
especially on the other side, belonged to the rich republic of Amain,
who built this tower as an exploratory gazeeboo from which they could
watch the motions of the<a name="Page_465"></a> Saracens who were wont to annoy them with
plundering excursions; but after this fastness [was built] the people of
Amalfi usually defeated and chastised them. The ride over the opposite
side of the mountain was described as so uncommonly pleasant as made me
long to ride it with assistance of a pony. That, however, was
impossible. We arrived at a country house, near a large town situated in
a ravine or hollow, which was called La Cava from some concavities which
it exhibited.</p>

<p>We were received by Miss Whyte, an English lady who has settled at La
Cava, and she afforded us the warmest hospitality that is consistent
with a sadly cold chilling house. They may say what they like of the
fine climate of Naples&mdash;unquestionably they cannot say too much in its
favour, but yet when a day or two of cold weather does come, the
inhabitants are without the means of parrying the temporary inclemency,
which even a Scotsman would scorn to submit to. However, warm or cold,
to bed we went, and rising next morning at seven we left La Cava, and,
making something like a sharp turn backwards, but keeping nearer to the
Gulf of Salerno than in yesterday's journey, and nearer to its shore. We
had a good road towards Paestum, and in defiance of a cold drizzling day
we went on at a round pace. The country through which we travelled was
wooded and stocked with wild animals towards the fall of the hills, and
we saw at a nearer distance a large swampy plain, pastured by a
singularly bizarre but fierce-looking buffalo, though it might maintain
a much preferable stock. This palace of Barranco was anciently kept up
for the King's sport, but any young man having a certain degree of
interest is allowed to share in the chase, which it is no longer an
object to preserve. The guest, however, if he shoots a deer, or a
buffalo, or wild boar, must pay the keeper at a certain fixed price, not
much above its price in the market, which a sportsman would hardly think
above its worth for game of his own killing.<a name="Page_466"></a> The town of Salerno is a
beautiful seaport town, and it is, as it were, wrapt in an Italian cloak
hanging round the limbs, or, to speak common sense, the new streets
which they are rebuilding. We made no stop at Salerno, but continued to
traverse the great plain of that name, within sight of the sea, which is
chiefly pastured by that queer-looking brute, the buffalo, concerning
which they have a notion that it returns its value sooner, and with less
expense of feeding, than any other animal.</p>

<p>At length we came to two streams which join their forces, and would seem
to flow across the plain to the bottom of the hills. One, however, flows
so flat as almost scarcely to move, and sinking into a kind of stagnant
pool is swallowed up by the earth, without proceeding any further until,
after remaining buried for two or three [miles?] underground, it again
bursts forth to the light, and resumes its course. When we crossed this
stream by a bridge, which they are now repairing, we entered a spacious
plain, very like that which we had [left] and displaying a similar rough
and savage cultivation. Here savage herds were under the guardianship of
shepherds as wild as they were themselves, clothed in a species of
sheepskins, and carrying a sharp spear with which they herd and
sometimes kill their buffaloes. Their farmhouses are in very poor order,
and with every mark of poverty, and they have the character of being
moved to dishonesty by anything like opportunity; of this there was a
fatal instance, but so well avenged that it is not like to be repeated
till it has long faded out of memory. The story, I am assured, happened
exactly as follows:&mdash;A certain Mr. Hunt, lately married to a lady of his
own age, and, seeming to have had what is too often the Englishman's
characteristic of more money than wit, arrived at Naples a year or two
ago <i>en famille</i>, and desirous of seeing all the sights in the vicinity
of this celebrated place. Among others Paestum was not forgot. At one of
the poor farmhouses where they stopped, the inhabitant set <a name="Page_467"></a>her eyes on
a toilet apparatus which was composed of silver and had the appearance
of great value. The woman who spread this report addressed herself to a
youth who had been [under] arms, and undoubtedly he and his companions
showed no more hesitation than the person with whom the idea had
originated. Five fellows, not known before this time for any particular
evil, agreed to rob the English gentleman of the treasure of which he
had made such an imprudent display. They were attacked by the banditti
in several parties, but the principal attack was directed to Mr. Hunt's
carriage, a servant of that gentleman being, as well as himself, pulled
out of the carriage and watched by those who had undertaken to conduct
this bad deed. The man who had been the soldier, probably to keep up his
courage, began to bully, talk violently, and strike the <i>valet de
place</i>, who screamed out in a plaintive manner, &quot;Do not injure me.&quot; His
master, hoping to make some impression, said, &quot;Do not hurt my servant,&quot;
to which the principal brigand replied, &quot;If he dares to resist, shoot
him.&quot; The man who stood over Mr. Hunt unfortunately took the captain at
the word, and his shot mortally wounded the unfortunate gentleman and
his wife, who both died next day at our landlady's, Miss Whyte, who had
the charity to receive them that they might hear their own language on
their deathbed. The Neapolitan Government made the most uncommon
exertions. The whole of the assassins were taken within a fortnight, and
executed within a week afterwards. In this wild spot, rendered
unpleasing by the sad remembrance of so inhuman an accident, and the
cottages which served for refuge for so wretched and wild a people,
exist the celebrated ruins of Paestum. Being without arms of any kind,
the situation was a dreary one, and though I can scarce expect now to
defend myself effectually, yet the presence of [<i>illegible</i>] would have
been an infinite cordial. The ruins are of very great antiquity, which
for a very long time has not been <a name="Page_468"></a>suspected, as it was never supposed
that the Sybarites, a luxurious people, were early possessed of a style
of architecture simple, chaste, and inconceivably grand, which was lost
before the time of Augustus, who is said by Suetonius to have undertaken
a journey on purpose to visit these remains of an architecture, the most
simple and massive of which Italy at least has any other specimen. The
Greeks have specimens of the same kind, but they are composed not of
stone, like Paestum, but of marble. All this has been a discovery of
recent date. The ruins, which exist without exhibiting much demolition,
are three in number. The first is a temple of immense size, having a
portico of the largest columns of the most awful species of classic
architecture. The roof, which was composed of immense stones, was
destroyed, but there are remains of the Cella, contrived for the
sacrifices to which the priests and persons of high office were alone
[admitted].</p>

<p>A piece of architecture more massive, without being cumbrous or heavy,
was never invented by a mason.</p>

<p>A second temple in the same style was dedicated to Ceres as the large
one was to Neptune, on whose dominion they looked, and who was the
tutelar deity of Paestum, and so called from one of his Greek names. The
fane of Ceres is finished with the greatest accuracy and beauty of
proportion and taste, and in looking upon it I forgot all the unpleasant
feelings which at first oppressed me. The third was not a temple, but a
Basilica, or species of town-house, as it was called, having a third row
of pillars running up the middle, between the two which surrounded the
sides, and were common to the Basilica and temple both. These surprising
public edifices have therefore all a resemblance to each other, though
also points of distinction. If Sir William Gell makes clear his theory
he will throw a most precious light on the origin of civilisation,
proving that the sciences have not sprung at once into light and life,
but rose gradually <a name="Page_469"></a>with extreme purity, and continued to be practised
best by those who first invented them. Full of these reflections, we
returned to our hospitable Miss Whyte in a drizzling evening, but
unassassinated, and our hearts completely filled with the magnificence
of what we had seen. Miss Whyte had in the meanwhile, by her interest at
La Trinit&agrave; with the Abbot, obtained us permission to pay a visit to him,
and an invitation indeed to dinner, which only the weather and the
health of Sir William Gell and myself prevented our accepting. After
breakfast, therefore, on the 18th of March, we set out for the convent,
situated about two or three miles from the town in a very large ravine,
not unlike the bed of the Rosslyn river, and traversed by roads which
from their steepness and precipitancy are not at all laudable, but the
views were beautiful and changing incessantly, while the spring
advancing was spreading her green mantle over rock and tree, and making
that beautiful which was lately a blighted and sterile thicket. The
convent of Trinit&agrave; itself holds a most superb situation on the
projection of an ample rock. It is a large edifice, but not a handsome
one&mdash;the monks reserving their magnificence for their churches&mdash;but was
surrounded by a circuit of fortifications, which, when there was need,
were manned by the vassals of the convent in the style of the Feudal
system. This was in some degree the case at the present day. The Abbot,
a gentlemanlike and respectable-looking man, attended by several of his
monks, received us with the greatest politeness, and conducted us to the
building, where we saw two great sculptured vases, or more properly
sarcophagi, of [marble?], well carved in the antique style, and adorned
with the story of Meleager. They were in the shape of a large bath, and
found, I think, at Paestum. The old church had passed to decay about a
hundred years ago, when the present fabric was built; it is very
beautifully arranged, and worthy of the place, which is eminently
beautiful, and of the community, who <a name="Page_470"></a>are Benedictines&mdash;the most
gentlemanlike order in the Roman Church.</p>

<p>We were conducted to the private repertory of the chapel, which contains
a number of interesting deeds granted by sovereigns of the Grecian,
Norman, and even Saracen descent. One from Roger, king of Sicily,
extended His Majesty's protection to some half dozen men of consequence
whose names attested their Saracenism.</p>

<p>In all the society I have been since I commenced this tour, I chiefly
regretted on the present occasion the not having refreshed my Italian
for the purpose of conversation. I should like to have conversed with
the Churchmen very much, and they seem to have the same inclination, but
it is too late to be thought of, though I could read Italian well once.
The church might boast of a grand organ, with fifty-seven stops, all
which we heard played by the ingenious organist. We then returned to
Miss Whyte's for the evening, ate a mighty dinner, and battled cold
weather as we might.</p>

<p>In further remarks on Paestum I may say there is a city wall in
wonderful preservation, one of the gates of which is partly entire and
displays the figure of a Syren under the architrave, but the antiquity
of the sculpture is doubted, though not that of the inner part of the
gate&mdash;so at least thinks Sir William, our best authority on such
matters. Many antiquities have been, and many more probably will be,
discovered. Paestum is a place which adds dignity to the peddling trade
of the ordinary antiquarian.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 19.&mdash;This morning we set off at seven for Naples; we observed
remains of an aqueduct in a narrow, apparently designed for the purpose
of leading water to La Cava, but had no time to conjecture on the
subject, and took our road back to Pompeii, and passed through two towns
of the same name, Nocera dei [Cristiani] and Nocera dei Pagani.<a name="FNanchor_521_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_526"><sup>[521]</sup></a> In
the latter village the Saracens obtained a place <a name="Page_471"></a>of refuge, from which
it takes the name. It is also said that the circumstance is kept in
memory by the complexion and features of this second Nocera, which are
peculiarly of the African caste and tincture. After we passed Pompeii,
where the continued severity of the weather did not permit us, according
to our purpose, to take another survey, we saw in the adjacent village
between us and Portici the scene of two assassinations, still kept in
remembrance. The one I believe was from the motive of plunder. The head
of the assassin was set up after his execution upon a pillar, which
still exists, and it remained till the skull rotted to pieces. The other
was a story less in the common style, and of a more interesting
character:&mdash;A farmer of an easy fortune, and who might be supposed to
leave to his daughter, a very pretty girl and an only child, a fortune
thought in the village very considerable. She was, under the hope of
sharing such a prize, made up to by a young man in the neighbourhood,
handsome, active, and of a very good general character. He was of that
sort of person who are generally successful among women, and the girl
was supposed to have encouraged his addresses; but her father, on being
applied to, gave him a direct and positive refusal. The gallant resolved
to continue his addresses in hopes of overcoming this obstacle by his
perseverance, but the father's opposition seemed only to increase by the
lover's pertinacity. At length, as the father walked one evening smoking
his pipe upon the terrace before his door, the lover unhappily passed
by, and, struck with the instant thought that the obstacle to the
happiness of his life was now entirely in his own power, he rushed upon
the father, pierced him with three mortal stabs of his knife, and killed
him dead on the spot, and made his escape to the mountains. What was
most remarkable was that he was protected against the police, who went,
as was their duty, in quest of him, by the inhabitants of the
neighbourhood, who afforded him both shelter and such food <a name="Page_472"></a>as he
required, looking on him less as a wilful criminal than an unfortunate
man, who had been surprised by a strong and almost irresistible
temptation. So congenial, at this moment, is the love of vengeance to an
Italian bosom, and though chastised in general by severe punishment, so
much are criminals sympathised with by the community.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 20.&mdash;I went with Miss Talbot and Mr. Lushington and his sister
to the great and celebrated church of San Domenico Maggiore, which is
the most august of the Dominican churches. They once possessed eighteen
shrines in this part of Naples. It contains the tomb of St. Thomas
Aquinas, and also the tombs of the royal family, which remain in the
vestry. There are some large boxes covered with yellow velvet which
contain their remains, and which stand ranged on a species of shelf,
formed by the heads of a set of oaken presses which contain the
vestments of the monks. The pictures of the kings are hung above their
respective boxes, containing their bones, without any other means of
preserving them. At the bottom of the lofty and narrow room is the
celebrated Marquis di [Pescara], one of Charles V.'s most renowned
generals, who commanded at the battle of Pavia.... The church itself is
very large and extremely handsome, with many fine marble tombs in a very
good style of architecture. The time being now nearly the second week in
Lent, the church was full of worshippers.</p>

<blockquote><p>[While at Naples Sir Walter wrote frequently to his daughter, to
     Mr. Cadell, Mr. Laidlaw, and Mr. Lockhart. The latter says, &quot;Some
     of these letters were of a very melancholy cast; for the dream
     about his debts being all settled was occasionally broken.&quot; One may
     be given here. It is undated, but was written some time after
     receiving the news of the death of his little grandson, and shows
     the tender relations which existed between Sir Walter and his
     son-in-law:&mdash;</p>

<p>     &quot;MY DEAR LOCKHART,&mdash;I have written with such regularity that ... I
     will not recur to this painful subject.<a name="Page_473"></a> I hope also I have found
     you both persuaded that the best thing you can do, both of you, is
     to come out here, where you would find an inestimable source of
     amusement, many pleasant people, and living in very peaceful and
     easy society. I wrote you a full account of my own matters, but I
     have now more complete [information]. I am ashamed, for the first
     time in my life, of the two novels, but since the pensive public
     have taken them, there is no more to be said but to eat my pudding
     and to hold my tongue. Another thing of great interest requires to
     be specially mentioned. You may remember a work in which our dear
     and accomplished friend Lady Louisa condescended to take an oar,
     and which she has handled most admirably. It is a supposed set of
     extracts relative to James VI. from a collection in James VI.'s
     time, the costume (?) admirably preserved, and, like the
     fashionable wigs, more natural than one's own hair. This, with the
     Lives of the Novelists and some other fragments of my wreck, went
     ashore in Constable's, and were sold off to the highest bidder,
     viz., to Cadell, for himself and me. I wrote one or two fragments
     in the same style, which I wish should, according to original
     intention, appear without a name, and were they fairly lightly let
     off there is no fear of their making a blaze. I sent the whole
     packet either to yourself or Cadell, with the request. The copy,
     which I conclude is in your hands by the time this reaches you,
     might be set up as speedily and quietly as possible, taking some
     little care to draw the public attention to you, and consulting
     Lady Louisa about the proofs. The fun is that our excellent friend
     had forgot the whole affair till I reminded her of her kindness,
     and was somewhat inclined, like Lady Teazle, to deny the butler and
     the coach-horse. I have no doubt, however, she will be disposed to
     bring the matter to an end. The mode of publication I fancy you
     will agree should rest with Cadell. So, providing that the copy
     come to hand, which it usually does, though not very regularly, you
     will do me the kindness to get it out. My story of Malta will be
     with you by the time you have finished the Letters, and if it
     succeeds it will in a great measure enable me to attain the long
     projected and very desirable object of clearing me from all old
     encumbrances and expiring as rich a man as I could desire in my own
     freehold. And when you recollect that this has been wrought out in
     six years, the sum amounting to at least &pound;120,000, it is somewhat
     of a novelty in literature. I shall be as happy and rich as I
     please <a name="Page_474"></a>for the last days of my life, and play the good papa with
     my family without thinking on pounds, shillings, and pence. Cadell,
     with so fair a prospect before him, is in high spirits, as you will
     suppose, but I had a most uneasy time from the interruption of our
     correspondence. However, thank God, it is all as well as I could
     wish, and a great deal better than I ventured to hope. After the
     Siege of Malta I intend to close the [series] of <i>Waverley</i> with a
     poem in the style of the <i>Lay</i>, or rather of the <i>Lady of the
     Lake</i>, to be a L'Envoy, or final postscript to these tales. The
     subject is a curious tale of chivalry belonging to Rhodes. Sir
     Frederick Adam will give me a cast of a steam-boat to visit Greece,
     and you will come and go with me. We live in a Palazzo, which with
     a coach and the supporters thereof does not, table included, cost
     &pound;120 or &pound;130 a month. So you will add nothing to our expenses, but
     give us the great pleasure of assisting you when I fear literary
     things have a bad time. We will return to Europe through Germany,
     and see what peradventure we shall behold. I have written
     repeatedly to you on this subject, for you would really like this
     country extremely. You cannot tread on it but you set your foot
     upon some ancient history, and you cannot make scruple, as it is
     the same thing whether you or I are paymaster. My health continues
     good, and bettering, as the Yankees say. I have gotten a choice
     manuscript of old English Romances, left here by Richard, and for
     which I know I have got a lad can copy them at a shilling a day.
     The King has granted me liberty to carry it home with me, which is
     very good-natured. I expect to secure something for the Roxburghe
     Club. Our posts begin to get more regular. I hope dear baby is
     getting better of its accident, poor soul.&mdash;Love to Sophia and
     Walter.</p>

<a name="APRIL_1832"></a><h2>APRIL.</h2>
<br />

<p><i>April 15, Naples</i>.&mdash;I am on the eve of leaving Naples after a residence
of three or four months, my strength strongly returning, though the
weather has been very uncertain. What with the interruption occasioned
by the cholera and other inconveniences, I have not done much. I have
sent home only the letters by L.L. Stuart and three volumes of the Siege
of Malta. I sent them by Lord Cowper's son&mdash;Mr. Cowper returning, his
leave being out&mdash;and two chests of books by the Messrs. Turner, Malta,
who are to put them on board a vessel, to be forwarded to Mr. Cadell
through Whittaker. I have hopes they will come to hand safe. I have
bought a small closing carriage, warranted new and English, cost me
&pound;200, for the convenience of returning home. It carries Anne, Charles,
and the two servants, and we start to-morrow morning for Rome, after
which we shall be starting homeward, for the Greek scheme is blown up,
as Sir Frederick Adam is said to be going to Madras, so he will be
unable to send a frigate as promised. I have spent on the expenses of
medical persons and books, etc., a large sum, yet not excessive.</p>

<p>Meantime we [may] have to add a curious journey of it. The brigands, of
whom there are so many stories, are afloat once more, and many carriages
stopped. A curious and popular work would be a history of these
ruffians. Washington Irving has attempted something of the kind, <a name="Page_476"></a>but
the person attempting this should be an Italian, perfectly acquainted
with his country, character, and manners. Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;, an apothecary, told
me a singular [occurrence] which happened in Calabria about six years
ago, and which I may set down just now as coming from a respectable
authority, though I do not [vouch it].</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>DEATH OF IL BIZARRO.</p>

<p>This man was called, from his wily but inexorable temper, Il Bizarro,
<i>i.e.</i> the Bizar. He was captain of a gang of banditti, whom he governed
by his own authority, till he increased them to 1000 men, both on foot
and horseback, whom he maintained in the mountains of Calabria, between
the French and Neapolitans, both of which he defied, and pillaged the
country. High rewards were set upon his head, to very little purpose, as
he took care to guard himself against being betrayed by his own gang,
the common fate of those banditti who become great in their vocation. At
length a French colonel, whose name I have forgot, occupied the country
of Bizarro, with such success that he formed a cordon around him and his
party, and included him between the folds of a military column.
Well-nigh driven to submit himself, the robber with his wife, a very
handsome woman, and a child of a few months old, took a position beneath
the arch of an old bridge, and, by an escape almost miraculous, were not
perceived by a strong party whom the French maintained on the top of the
arch. Night at length came without a discovery, which every moment might
have made. When it became quite dark, the brigand, enjoining strictest
silence on the female and child, resolved to steal from his place of
shelter, and as they issued forth, kept his hand on the child's throat.
But as, when they began to move, the child naturally cried, its father
in a rage stiffened his grip so relentlessly that the poor infant never
offended more in <a name="Page_477"></a>the same manner. This horrid [act] led to the
conclusion of the robber's life.</p>

<p>His wife had never been very fond of him, though he trusted her more
than any who approached him. She had been originally the wife of another
man, murdered by her second husband, which second marriage she was
compelled to undergo, and to affect at least the conduct of an
affectionate wife. In their wanderings she alone knew where he slept for
the night. He left his men in a body upon the top of an open hill, round
which they set watches. He then went apart into the woods with his wife,
and having chosen a glen&mdash;an obscure and deep thicket of the woods,
there took up his residence for the night. A large Calabrian sheepdog,
his constant attendant, was then tied to a tree at some distance to
secure his slumbers, and having placed his carabine within reach of his
lair, he consigned himself to such sleep as belongs to his calling. By
such precautions he had secured his rest for many years.</p>

<p>But after the death of the child, the measure of his offence towards the
unhappy mother was full to the brim, and her thoughts became determined
on revenge. One evening he took up his quarters for the night with these
precautions, but without the usual success. He had laid his carabine
near him, and betaken himself to rest as usual, when his partner arose
from his side, and ere he became sensible she had done so, she seized
[his carabine], and discharging [it] in his bosom, ended at once his
life and crimes. She finished her work by cutting off the brigand's
head, and carrying it to the principal town of the province, where she
delivered it to the police, and claimed the reward attached to his head,
which was paid accordingly. This female still lives, a stately,
dangerous-looking woman, yet scarce ill thought of, considering the
provocation.</p>

<p>The dog struggled extremely to get loose on hearing the shot. Some say
the female shot it; others that, in its rage, <a name="Page_478"></a>it very nearly gnawed
through the stout young tree to which it was tied. He was worthy of a
better master.</p>

<p>The distant encampment of the band was disturbed by the firing of the
Bizarro's carabine at midnight. They ran through the woods to seek the
captain, but finding him lifeless and headless, they became so much
surprised that many of them surrendered to the government, and
relinquished their trade, and the band of Bizarro, as it lived by his
ingenuity, broke up by his death.</p>

<p>A story is told nearly as horrible as the above, respecting the cruelty
of this bandit, which seems to entitle him to be called one of the most
odious wretches of his name. A French officer, who had been active in
the pursuit of him, fell into his hands, and was made to die [the death]
of Marsyas or Saint Polycarp&mdash;that is, the period being the middle of
summer, he was flayed alive, and, being smeared with honey, was exposed
to all the intolerable insects of a southern sky. The corps were also
informed where they might find their officer if they thought proper to
send for him. As more than two days elapsed before the wretched man was
found, nothing save his miserable relics could be discovered.</p>

<p>I do not warrant these stories, but such are told currently.</p>

<p>[<i>Tour from Naples to Rome</i>], <i>April</i> 16.&mdash;Having remained several
months at Naples, we resolved to take a tour to Rome during the Holy
Week and view the ecclesiastical shows which take place, although
diminished in splendour by the Pope's poverty. So on the 15th we set out
from Naples, my children unwell. We passed through the Champ de
Mars,<a name="FNanchor_522_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_527"><sup>[522]</sup></a> and so on by the Terra di Lavoro, a rich and fertile country,
and breakfasted at St. Agatha, a wretched place, but we had a
disagreeable experience. I had purchased a travelling carriage, assured
that it was English-built and <a name="Page_479"></a>all that. However, when we were half a
mile on our journey, a bush started and a wheel came off, but by dint of
contrivances we fought our way back to Agatha, where we had a miserable
lodging and wretched dinner. The people were civil, however, and no
bandits abroad, being kept in awe by the escort of the King of
Westphalia,<a name="FNanchor_523_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_528"><sup>[523]</sup></a> who was on his road to Naples. The wheel was
effectually repaired, and at seven in the morning we started with some
apprehension of suffering from crossing the very moist marshes called
the Pontine Bogs, which lie between Naples and Rome. This is not the
time when these exhalations are most dangerous, though they seem to be
safe at no time. We remarked the celebrated Capua, which is
distinguished into the new and old. The new Capua is on the banks of the
river Volturno, which conducts its waters into the moats. It is still a
place of some strength in modern war. The approach to the old Capua is
obstructed by an ancient bridge of a singular construction, and consists
of a number of massive towers half ruined. We did not pass very near to
them, but the site seems very strong. We passed Sinuessa or Sessa, an
ancient Greek town, situated not far from shore. The road from Naples to
Capua resembles an orchard on both sides, but, alas! it runs through
these infernal marshes, which there is no shunning, and which the
example of many of my friends proves to be exceeding dangerous. The
road, though it has the appearance of winding among hills, is in fact,
on the left side, limited by the sea-coast running northward. It comes
into its more proper line at a celebrated sea-marsh called Cameria,<a name="FNanchor_524_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_529"><sup>[524]</sup></a>
concerning which the oracle said &quot;<i>Ne moveas Camarinam</i>,&quot; and the
transgression <a name="Page_480"></a>of which precept brought on a pestilence. The road here
is a wild pass bounded by a rocky precipice; on one hand covered with
wild shrubs, flowers, and plants, and on the other by the sea. After
this we came to a military position, where Murat used to quarter a body
of troops and cannonade the English gunboats, which were not slow in
returning the compliment. The English then garrisoned Italy and Sicily
under Sir [John Stuart]. We supped at this place, half fitted up as a
barrack, half as an inn. (The place is now called Terracina.) Near this
a round tower is shown, termed the tomb of Cicero, which may be doubted.
I ought, before quitting Terracina, to have mentioned the view of the
town and castle of Gaeta from the Pass. It is a castle of great
strength. I should have mentioned Aversa, remarkable for a house for
insane persons, on the humane plan of not agitating their passions.
After a long pilgrimage on this beastly road we fell asleep in spite of
warnings to the contrary, and before we beat the <i>reveille</i> were within
twenty miles of the city of Rome. I think I felt the effects of the bad
air and damp in a very bad headache.</p>

<p>After a steep climb up a slippery ill-paved road Velletri received us,
and accommodated us in an ancient villa or ch&acirc;teau, the original
habitation of an old noble. I would have liked much to have taken a look
at it; but I am tired by my ride. I fear my time for such researches is
now gone. Monte Albano, a pleasant place, should also be mentioned,
especially a forest of grand oaks, which leads you pretty directly into
the vicinity of Rome. My son Charles had requested the favour of our
friend Sir William Gell to bespeak a lodging, which, considering his bad
health, was scarcely fair. My daughter had imposed the same favour, but
they had omitted to give precise direction how to correspond with their
friends concerning the execution of their commission. So there we were,
as we had reason to think, possessed of two apartments and not knowing
<a name="Page_481"></a>the [way] to any of them. We entered Rome by a gate<a name="FNanchor_525_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_530"><sup>[525]</sup></a> renovated by
one of the old Pontiffs, but which, I forget, and so paraded the streets
by moonlight to discover, if possible, some appearance of the learned
Sir William Gell or the pretty Mrs. Ashley. At length we found our old
servant who guided us to the lodgings taken by Sir William Gell, where
all was comfortable, a good fire included, which our fatigue and the
chilliness of the night required. We dispersed as soon as we had taken
some food, wine, and water.</p>

<p>We slept reasonably, but on the next morning</p>

<blockquote><p>EDINBURGH, 21 COMELY BANK, <i>13th April</i> 1828.</p></blockquote>

<p>SIR,&mdash;In February last I had the honour to receive a letter from Von
Goethe, announcing the speedy departure, from Weimar, of a Packet for
me, in which, among other valuables, should be found &quot;two medals,&quot; to be
delivered &quot;<i>mit verbindlichsten Gr&uuml;ssen&quot;</i> to Sir Walter Scott. By a slow
enough conveyance this <i>K&auml;stchen</i>, with its medals in perfect safety,
has at length yesterday come to hand, and now lays on me the enviable
duty of addressing you.</p>

<p>Among its multifarious contents, the Weimar Box failed not to include a
long letter&mdash;considerable portion of which, as it virtually belongs to
yourself, you will now allow me to transcribe. Perhaps it were thriftier
in me to reserve this for another occasion; but considering how seldom
such a Writer obtains such a Critic, I cannot but reckon it pity that
this friendly intercourse between them should be anywise delayed.</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Sehen Sie Herrn Walter Scott, so sagen Sie ihm auf das
     verbindlichste in meinem Namen Dank f&uuml;r den lieben heitern Brief,
     gerade in dem sch&ouml;nen Sinne geschrieben, dass der Mensch <a name="Page_484"></a>dem
     Menschen werth seyn m&uuml;sse. So auch habe ich dessen Leben Napoleon's
     erhalten und solches in diesen Winterabenden und N&auml;chten von Anfang
     bis zu Ende mit Aufmerksamkeit durchgelesen.</p>

<p>     &quot;Mir war h&ouml;chst bedeutend zu sehen, wie sich der erste Erz&auml;hler des
     Jahrhunderts einem so ungemeinen Gesch&auml;ft unterzieht und uns die
     &uuml;berwichtigen Begebenheiten, deren Zeuge zu seyn wir gezwungen
     wurden, in fertigem Zuge vor&uuml;berf&uuml;hrt. Die Abtheilung durch Capitel
     in grosse zusammengeh&ouml;rige Massen giebt den verschlungenen
     Ereignissen die reinste Fasslichkeit, und so wird dann auch der
     Vortrag des Einzelnen auf das unsch&auml;tzbarste deutlich und
     anschaulich.</p>

<p>     &quot;Ich las es im Original, und da wirkte es ganz eigentlich seiner
     Natur nach. Es ist ein patriotischer Britte der spricht, der die
     Handlungen des Feindes nicht wohl mit g&uuml;nstigen Augen ansehen kann,
     der als ein rechtlicher Staatsb&uuml;rger zugleich mit den
     Unternehmungen der Politik auch die Forderungen der Sittlichkeit
     befriedigt w&uuml;nscht, der den Gegner, im frechen Laufe des Gl&uuml;cks,
     mit unseligen Folgen bedroht, und auch im bittersten Verfall ihn
     kaum bedauern kann.</p>

<p>     &quot;Und so war mir noch ausserdem das Werk von der gr&ouml;ssten Bedeutung,
     indem es mich an das Miterlebte theils erinnerte, theils mir
     manches Uebersehene nun vorf&uuml;hrte, mich auf einem unerwarteten
     Standpunkt versetzte, mir zu erw&auml;gen gab was ich f&uuml;r abgeschlossen
     hielt, und besonders auch mich bef&auml;higte die Gegner dieses
     wichtigen Werkes, an denen es nicht fehlen kann, zu beurtheilen und
     die Einwendungen, die sie von ihrer Seite vortragen, zu w&uuml;rdigen.</p>

<p>     Sie sehen hieraus dass zu Ende des Jahres keine h&ouml;here Gabe h&auml;tte
     zu mir gelangen k&ouml;nnen. Es ist dieses Werk mir zu einem goldenen
     Netz geworden, womit ich die Schattenbilder meines vergangenen
     Lebens aus den Lethes-Fluthen mit reichem Zuge herauszuforschen
     mich besch&auml;ftige.</p>

<p>     &quot;Ungef&auml;hr dasselbige denke ich in dem n&auml;chsten St&uuml;cke von <i>Kunst
     und Alterthum</i> zu sagen.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>With regard to the medals, which are, as I expected, the two well-known
likenesses of Goethe himself, it could be no hard matter to dispose of
them safely here, or transmit them to you, if you required it, without
delay: but being in this curious fashion appointed as it were Ambassador
between two Kings of Poetry, I would willingly discharge my mission with
the <a name="Page_485"></a>solemnity that beseems such a business, and naturally it must
flatter my vanity and love of the marvellous, to think that, by means of
a Foreigner whom I have never seen, I might now have access to my native
Sovereign, whom I have so often seen in public and so often wished that
I had claim to see and know in private and near at hand.&mdash;Till
Whitsunday I continue to reside here; and shall hope that some time
before that period I may have opportunity to wait on you, and, as my
commission bore, to hand you these memorials in person.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I abide your further orders in this matter; and so, with all
the regard which belongs to one to whom I in common with other millions
owe so much,&mdash;I have the honour to be,</p>

<p>Sir, most respectfully your servant, THOMAS CARLYLE.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>two</i> medals specially intended for you, there have come
<i>four</i> more, which I am requested generally to dispose of amongst
&quot;<i>Wohlwollenden</i>,&quot; Perhaps Mr. Lockhart, whose merits in respect of
German Literature, and just appreciation of this its Patriarch and
Guide, are no secret, will do me the honour to accept of one and direct
me through your means how I am to have it conveyed?</p>

<p><i>Translation of the Letter from Goethe</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Should you see Sir Walter Scott, be so kind as return to him my most
grateful thanks for his dear and cheerful letter,&mdash;a letter written in
just that beautiful temper which makes one man feel himself to be worth
something to another. Say, too, that I received his Life of Napoleon,
and have read it this winter&mdash;in the evening and at night&mdash;with
attention from beginning to end. To me it was full of meaning to observe
how the first novelist of the century took upon himself a task and
business, so apparently foreign to him, and passed under review with
rapid stroke those important events of which it had been our fate to be
eye-witnesses. The division into chapters, embracing masses of
intimately connected events, gives a clearness to the historical
sequence that otherwise might have been only too easily confused, while,
at the same time, the individual events in each chapter are described
with a clearness and a vividness quite invaluable.</p>

<p>I read the work in the original, and the impression it made upon me was
thus free from the disturbing influence of a foreign <a name="Page_486"></a>medium. I found
myself listening to the words of a patriotic Briton, who finds it
impossible to regard the actions of the enemy with a favourable eye,&mdash;an
honest citizen this, whose desire is, that while political
considerations shall always receive due weight, the demands of morality
shall never be overlooked; one who, while the enemy is borne along in
his wanton course of good fortune, cannot forbear to point with warning
finger to the inevitable consequences, and in his bitterest disaster can
with difficulty find him worthy of a tear.</p>

<p>The book was in yet another respect of the greatest importance to me, in
that it brought back to my remembrance events through which I had
lived&mdash;now showing me much that I had overlooked, now transplanting me
to some unexpected standpoint, thus forcing me to reconsider a question
which I had looked upon as settled, and in a special manner putting me
in a position to pass judgment upon the unfavourable critics of this
book&mdash;for these cannot fail&mdash;and to estimate at their true value the
objections which are sure to be made from their side. From all this you
will understand how the end of last year could have brought with it no
gift more welcome to me than this book. The work has become to me as it
were a golden net, wherewith I can recover from out the waves of Lethe
the shadowy pictures of my past life, and in that rich draught I am
finding my present employment.</p>

<p>I intend making a few remarks to the same purpose in the next number of

<h4><i>Contents of the Volume of Irish Manuscript referred to</i>, vol. ii. p.
<a href="#Page_289">289</a>.</h4>


<p>1. The rudiments of an Irish Grammar and Prosody; the first leaf
wanting.</p>

<p>2. The Book of <i>Rights</i>; giving an account of ye rents and <a name="Page_487"></a>subsidies of
the kings and princes of Ireland. It is said to have (been) written by
Beinin MacSescnen, the Psalmist of Saint Patrick. It is entirely in
verse, except a few sentences of prose taken from ye booke of
Glandelogh.</p>

<p>3. A short poem giving an account of ye disciples and favourites of St.
Patrick.</p>

<p>4. A poem of Eochy O Flyn's; giving an account of the followers of
Partholan, the first invader of Ireland after the flood.</p>

<p>5. A poem written by Macliag, Brian Boruay's poet Laureat. It gives an
account of the twelve sons of Kennedy, son of Lorcan, Brian's father;
and of ye Dalcassian race in general.</p>

<p>6. A book of annals from the year 976 to 1014, including a good account
of the battle of Clontarf, etc.</p>

<p>7. A collection of Historical poems by different authors, such as O
Dugan, etc., and some extracts, as they seem, from the psalter of
Cashill, written by Cormac-mac-Cuilinan, Archbishop and King of Leath
Mogha, towards the beginning or middle of the ninth century; Cobhach O
Carmon and O Heagusa have their part in these poems. In them are
interspersed many other miscellaneous tracts, among which is one called
Sgeul-an-Erin, but deficient, wherein mention is made of Garbh mac
Stairn, said to be slain by Cuchullin; a treatise explaining the Ogham
manner of writing which is preserved in this book; the privileges of the
several kings and princes of Ireland, in making their tours of the
Kingdom, and taking their seats at the Feis of Tara; and an antient
moral and political poem as an advice to princes and chieftains, other
poems and prophecies, etc., chronological and religious, disposed in no
certain order.</p>

<p>8. The last will and testament of Cormac-mac-Cuilinan in verse.</p>

<p>9. The various forms of the Ogham.</p>

<p>10. The death of Cuchullin, an antient story interspersed with poems,
which, if collected, would contain the entire substance of the
composition, which is very good (except in one instance) and founded on
real fact.</p>

<p>11. The bloody revenge of Conall Cearnach for the death of Cuchullin.
This may be considered as the sequel of the preceding story, and of
equal authority and antiquity. It is written in the very same style, and
contains a beautiful elegy on Cuchullin by his wife Eimhir.</p><a name="Page_488"></a>

<p>12. The death of Cormac Con luings, written in the same style with the
foregoing stories.</p>

<p>13. The genealogies of all ye principal Irish and Anglo-Norman families
of Ireland to the end.</p>

<p>14. A very good copy of the Cath-Gabhra.</p>

<p>The above table of contents is in the handwriting of Dr. Matthew Young,
late Bishop of Clonfert, a man possessing the highest talents and
learning, and who had been acquainted with the Irish language from his
infancy. J.B.</p>

<h4>&quot;<i>A Former Empress</i>.&quot;&mdash;p. <a href="#Page_451">451</a>.
</h4>

<p>The Church of Santa Maria del Carmine contains relics dear alike to the
romance of democracy and empire. It was from this church that Masaniello
harangued the fickle populace in vain; it was here that he was
despatched by three bandits in the pay of the Duke of Maddaloni; and
here he found an honourable interment during a rapid reflux of popular
favour. In this church, too, lies Conradin the last prince of the great
house of Suabia, with his companion in arms and in death, Frederic, son
of the Margrave of Baden, with pretensions, through his mother, to the
Dukedom of Austria. The features of the medi&aelig;val building have long
since been obliterated by reconstructions of the 17th and 18th
centuries, while round the tomb of Conradin a tissue of fictions has
been woven by the piety and fondness of after times. The sceptics of
modern research do not, however, forbid us to believe that there may be
an element of truth in the beautiful legend of the visit and
benefactions of Elizabeth Margaret of Bavaria, the widowed mother of
Conradin, erroneously dignified with the title of Empress, to the
resting-place of her son. Her statue in the convent, with a purse in her
hand, seems to attest the tale, which was no doubt related to the
Scottish Poet, and may well have stirred his fancy. What the epitaph was
which he copied we cannot now determine. It is not pretended that the
unhappy lady was buried here, but two inscriptions commemorate the
ferocity of Charles of Anjou, and the vicissitudes of fortune which
befell his victims. One, believed to be of great antiquity, is attached
to a cross or pillar erected at the place of execu<a name="Page_489"></a>tion. It breathes the
insolence of the conqueror mingled with a barbarous humour embodied in a
play on words&mdash;for &quot;Asturis&quot; has a double reference to the kite and to
the place &quot;Astura,&quot; at which the fugitive Princes were captured:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Asturis ungue Leo Pullum rapiens Aquilinum<br /></span>
<span>Hic deplumavit, acephalumque dedit.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The other lines, in the Church, of more modern date, are conceived in a
humaner spirit, and may possibly be those which touched the heart of the
old worshipper of chivalry.</p>

<h4>&quot;Mother Goose's Tales,&quot; p. <a href="#Page_459">459</a>. <i>The following note by a distinguished
authority on Nursery Tales, will be read with interest.</i>
</h4>

<p>&quot;It is unfortunate that Sir Walter Scott did not record in his Diary the
dates of the Neapolitan collection of 'Mother Goose's Tales,' and of the
early French editions with which he was acquainted. He may possibly have
meant Basile's <i>Lo Cunto de li cunti</i> (Naples, 1637-44 and 1645), which
contains some stories analogous to those which Scott mentions. There can
be no doubt, however, that France, not Italy, can claim the shapes of
<i>Blue Beard</i>, <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>, <i>Puss in Boots</i>, and the other
'Tales of Mother Goose,' which are known best in England. Other forms of
these nursery traditions exist, indeed, not only in Italian, but in most
European and some Asiatic and African languages. But their classical
shape in literature is that which<a name="Page_490"></a> Charles Perrault gave them, in his
<i>Contes de ma M&egrave;re l'Oie</i>, of 1697. Among the 'early French editions'
which Sir Walter knew, probably none were older than Dr. Douce's copy of
1707, now in the Bodleian. The British Museum has no early copy. There
was an example of the First Edition sold in the Hamilton sale: another,
or the same, in blue morocco, belonged to Charles Nodier, and is
described in his <i>M&eacute;langes</i>. The only specimen in the Public Libraries
of Paris is in the Biblioth&egrave;que Victor Cousin. It is probable that the
'dumpy duodecimo' in the Neapolitan dialect, seen by Scott, was a
translation of Perrault's famous little work. The stories in it, which
are not in the early French editions, may be <i>L'Adroite Princesse</i>, by a
lady friend of Perrault's, and <i>Peau d'Ane</i> in prose, a tale which
Perrault told only in verse. These found their way into French and
Flemish editions after 1707. Our earliest English translation seems to
be that of 1729, and the name of 'Mother Goose' does not appear to occur
in English literature before that date. It is probably a translation of
'Ma M&egrave;re l'Oie,' who gave her name to such old wives' fables in France
long before Perrault's time, as the spider, Ananzi, gives his name to
the 'Nancy Stories' of the negroes in the West Indies. Among Scott's
Century of Inventions, unfulfilled projects for literary work, few are
more to be regretted than his intended study of the origin of Popular
Tales, a topic no longer thought 'obnoxious to ridicule.'&quot;&mdash;A.L.</p><a name="Page_491"></a>

<a name="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14">[14]</a><div class="note"><p> Did Constable ruin Scott, as has been generally supposed?
It is right to say that such a charge was not made during the lifetime
of either. Immediately after Scott's death Miss Edgeworth wrote to Sir
James Gibson-Craig and asked him for authentic information as to Sir
Walter's connection with Constable. Sir James in reply stated that to
his personal knowledge Mr. Constable had, in his anxiety to save Scott,
about 1814 [1813], commenced a system of accommodation bills which could
not fail to produce, and actually did produce, the ruin of both parties.
To another correspondent, some years later, he wrote still more strongly
(<i>Memoirs,</i> vol. iii. p. 457).
</p><p>
Scott appears to have been aware of the facts so far, as he says to
Laidlaw, in a letter of December 16, 1825, &quot;The confusion of 1814 is a
joke to this ... but it arises out of the nature of the same connection
which gives, and has given, me a fortune;&quot; and Mr. Lockhart says that
the firm of J.B. &amp; Co. &quot;had more than once owed its escape from utter
ruin and dishonour&quot; through Constable's exertions.&mdash;<i>Life</i>, vol. v. p.
150.
</p><p>
On reading the third volume of Constable's Memoirs (3 vols. 8vo, 1873),
one cannot fail to see that all the three parties&mdash;printer, publisher,
and author&mdash;were equal sharers in the imprudences that led to the
disaster in 1826. Whether Mr. Constable was right in recommending
further advances to the London house is doubtful; but if it was an error
of judgment, it was one which appears to have been shared by Mr. Cadell
and Mr. James Ballantyne. It must be admitted that the three firms were
equally culpable in maintaining for so many years a system of fictitious
credit. Constable, at least, from a letter to Scott, printed in vol.
iii. p. 274, had become seriously alarmed as early as August 8, 1823.
</p><p>
That Constable was correct in his estimate of the value of the literary
property has been shown by the large sums realised from the sale of
Scott's works since 1829; and that his was the brain (&quot;the pendulum of
the clock&quot; as Scott termed it) to plan is also shown by the fact that
the so-called &quot;favourite&quot; edition, the <i>magnum opus</i>, appears to have
been Constable's idea (<i>Memoirs</i>, vol. iii. p. 255), although, according
to the <i>Annual Register</i> of 1849, Mr. Cadell claimed the merit of a
scheme which he had &quot;quietly and privately matured.&quot;</p></div>

Office, when he was in London at the close of 1826, &quot;were some which
represented one of Bonaparte's attendants at St. Helena, General
Gourgaud, as having been guilty of gross unfairness, giving the English
Government private information that the Emperor's complaints of
ill-usage were utterly unfounded, and yet then and afterwards aiding and
assisting the delusion in France as to the harshness of Sir Hudson
Lowe's conduct towards his captive. Sir Walter, when using these
remarkable documents, guessed that Gourgaud might be inclined to fix a
personal quarrel on himself; and there now appeared in the newspapers a
succession of hints that the General was seriously bent on this purpose.
He applied as <i>Colonel Grogg</i> would have done forty years before to <i>The
Baronet</i>&quot; [W. Clerk].&mdash;<i>Life</i>, vol. ix. pp. 142-3.
</p><p>
A short time previously Gourgaud had had a quarrel with Count S&eacute;gur
regarding the latter's <i>History of the Russian Campaign</i>, to which he
wrote a reply in 1825, and then fought a duel with the author in support
of his allegations. In Scott's case, however, it came to nothing beyond
a paper war, which Sir Walter declined to prolong, leaving the question
to be decided by the general public. It is due to Gourgaud to state that
on two occasions he saved Napoleon's life, though his subsequent
information to the British Government did not tend to increase his
popularity with the Bonapartists. He died at Paris in his sixty-ninth
year on July 25th, 1852.</p></div>

which he had purchased by Sir Walter's advice.
</p><p>
The following amusing narrative of what took place on Tweedside when
these two old friends were in their prime is given in Mr. Richardson's
own words:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;On a beautiful morning in September 1810 I started with Sir Walter from
Ashiestiel. We began nearly under the ruins of Elibank, and in sight of
the 'Hanging Tree.' I only had a rod, but Sir Walter walked by my side,
now quoting Izaak Walton, as, 'Fish me this stream by inches,' and now
delighting me with a profusion of Border stories. After the capture of
numerous fine trout, I hooked something greater and unseen, which
powerfully ran out my line. Sir Walter got into a state of great
excitement, exclaiming, 'It's a fish! It's a fish! Hold up your rod!
Give him line!' and so on. The rod, which belonged to one of his boys,
broke, and put us both into great alarm; but I contrived, by ascending
the steep bank and holding down the rod, still to give play to the reel,
till, after a good quarter of an hour's struggle, a trout, for so it
turned out to be, was conducted round a little peninsula. Sir Walter
jumped into the water, seized him, and threw him out on the grass. Tom
Purdie came up a little time after, and was certainly rather discomposed
at my success. 'It will be some sea brute,' he observed; but he became
satisfied that it was a fine river-trout, and such as, he afterwards
admitted, had not been killed in Tweed for twenty years; and when I
moved down the water, he went, as Sir Walter afterwards observed, and
gave it a kick on the head, exclaiming, 'To be ta'en by the like o' him
frae Lunnon!'&quot;</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39">[39]</a><div class="note"><p> Scott's unwearied interest in James Hogg, despite the
waywardness of this imaginative genius, is one of the most beautiful
traits in his character. Readers of Mr. Lockhart's <i>Life</i>, do not
require to be reminded of the active part he took in promoting the
welfare of the &quot;Ettrick Shepherd&quot; on many occasions, from the outset of
their acquaintance in 1801 until the end of his life.
</p><p>
Hogg was a strange compound of boisterous roughness and refinement in
expression, and these odd contrasts surprised strangers such as Moore
and Ticknor. The former was shocked, and the latter said his
conversation was a perpetual contradiction to the exquisite delicacy of
<i>Kilmeny</i>.
</p><p>
The critics of the day, headed by Professor Wilson, declared he was
Burns's rival as a song-writer, and his superior in anything relating to
external nature! indeed they wrote of him as unsurpassed by poet or
painter in his fairy tales of ancient time, dubbing him Poet Laureate to
the Queen of Elfland; and yet his unrefined manner tempted these friends
to speak of him familiarly as the greatest hog in all Apollo's herd, or
the Boar of the Forest, etc. etc.
</p><p>
Wordsworth, however, on November 21, 1835, when his brother bard had
just left the sunshine for the sunless land, wrote from his heart the
noble lines ending&mdash;

of Commander of the Forces, which he had accepted under the new Premier,

from &quot;one who had in former happy days been no stranger,&quot; and on turning
to the signature he found to his astonishment that it was from Lady Jane
Stuart, with whom he had had no communication since the memorable visit
he had made to Invermay in the autumn of 1796. The letter was simply a
formal request on behalf of a friend for permission to print some
ballads in Scott's handwriting which were in an album that had
apparently belonged to her daughter, yet it stirred his nature to its
depths. The substance of his reply may be gathered from the second
letter, which he had just read before making this sad entry in his
Journal.&mdash;Lady Jane tells him that she would convey to him the
Manuscript Book
</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;,&quot;as a <i>secret</i> and <i>sacred</i> Treasure, could I but know that you
     would take it as I give it without a drawback or misconstruction of
     my intentions;&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>
and she adds&mdash;
</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;Were I to lay open my heart (of which you know little indeed) you
     would find how it has and ever shall be warm towards you. My age
     [she was then seventy-four] encourages me, and I have longed to
     tell you. Not the mother who bore you followed you more anxiously
     (though secretly) with her blessing than I! Age has tales to tell
     and sorrows to unfold.&quot;</p></blockquote>

Some years ago the proprietor, moved by the entreaties of the people,
and on the positive testimony of two elders of the Free Church, that the
creature was hiding in his loch, attempted its destruction by pumping
and running off the water; this plan having failed owing to the
smallness of the pumps, though it was persevered in for two years, he
next tried poisoning the water by emptying into the loch a quantity of
quick lime!!&mdash;Whatever harm was thus done to the trout none was
experienced by <i>the Beast</i>, which it is rumoured has been seen in the

<a name="Footnote_108_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108_108">[108]</a><div class="note"><p> During Sir Walter's illness in 1818-19 Mr. Skene was with
him at Abbotsford, and he records a curious incident regarding Dryburgh
which may be given here:&mdash;&quot;For nearly two years he had to struggle for
his life with that severe illness, which the natural strength of his
constitution at length proved sufficient to throw off. With its
disappearance, although restored to health, disappeared also much of his
former vigour of body, activity, and power of undergoing fatigue, while
in personal appearance he had advanced twenty years in the downward
course of life; his hair had become bleached to pure white and scanty
locks; the fire of his eye quenched; and his step, more uncertain, had
lost the vigorous swinging gait with which he was used to proceed; in
fact, old age had by many years anticipated its usual progress and
marked how severely he had suffered. The complaint, that of gall-stones,
was one of extreme bodily suffering. During his severest attack he had
been alone at Abbotsford with his daughter Sophia, before her marriage
to Mr. Lockhart, and had sent to say that he was desirous I should come
to him, which I did, and remained for ten days till the attack had
subsided. During its course the extreme violence of the pain end
spasmodic contraction of the muscles of the stomach were such that I
scarcely expected the powers of endurance could sustain him through the
trial, and so much at times was he exhausted by it as to leave us in
alarm as to what the result had actually been. One night I shall not
soon forget: he had been frequently and severely ill during the day, and
having been summoned to his room in the middle of the night, where his
daughter was already standing, the picture of deep despair, at his
bed-side, the attack seemed intense, and we followed the directions left
by the physician to assuage it. At length it seemed to subside, and he
fell back exhausted on the pillow, his eyes were closed, and his
countenance wan and livid. Apparently with corresponding misgivings, his
daughter at one side of the bed and I at the other gazed for some time
intently and in silence on his countenance, and then glanced with
anxious inquiring looks to each other, till, at length, having placed my
finger on his pulse, to ascertain whether it had actually ceased to
throb, I shall never forget the sudden beam which again brightened his
daughter's countenance, and for a moment dispelled the intense
expression of anxiety which had for some time overspread it, when Sir
Walter, aware of my feeling his pulse, and the probable purpose,
whispered, with a faint voice, but without opening his eyes, 'I am not
<i>yet</i> gone.' After some time he revived, and gave us a proof of the
mastery of his mind over the sufferings of the body. 'Do you recollect,'
he said to me, 'a small round turret near the gate of the Monastery of
Aberbrothwick, and placed so as to overhang the street?' Upon answering
that I did perfectly, and that a picturesque little morsel it was, he
said, 'Well, I was over there when a mob had assembled, excited by some
purpose, which I do not recollect, but failing of their original
intention, they took umbrage at the little venerable emblem of
aristocracy, which still bore its weather-stained head so conspicuously
aloft, and, resolving to humble it with the dust, they got a stout
hawser from a vessel in the adjoining harbour, which a sailor lad,
climbing up, coiled round the body of the little turret, and the rabble
seizing the rope by both ends tugged and pulled, and laboured long to
strangle and overthrow the poor old turret, but in vain, for it
withstood all their endeavours. Now that is exactly the condition of my
poor stomach: there is a rope twisted round it, and the malicious devils
are straining and tugging at it, and, faith, I could almost think that I
sometimes hear them shouting and cheering each other to their task, and
when they are at it I always have the little turret and its tormentors
before my eyes.' He complained that particular ideas fixed themselves
down upon his mind, which he had not the power of shaking off; but this
was, in fact, the obvious consequence of the quantity of laudanum which
it was necessary for him to swallow to allay the spasms.
</p><p>
&quot;After he had got some repose, and had become rather better in the
morning, he said, with a smile on his countenance, 'If you will promise
not to laugh at me I have a favour to ask. Do you know I have taken a
childish desire to see the place where I am to be laid when I go home,
which there is some probability may not now be long delayed. Now, as I
cannot go to Dryburgh Abbey&mdash;that is out of the question at present&mdash;it
would give me much pleasure if you would take a ride down and bring me a
drawing of that spot, which he minutely described the position of, and
mentioned the exact point where he wished it drawn, that the site of his
future grave might appear. His wish was accordingly complied
with.&quot;&mdash;<i>Reminiscences</i>.</p></div>

said] appeared early in December, and their reception was more rapturous
than that of any one of his works since <i>Ivanhoe</i>. He had solved for the
first time the problem of narrating history, so as at once to excite and
gratify the curiosity of youth, and please and instruct the wisest of
mature minds. The popularity of the book has grown with every year that
has since elapsed; it is equally prized in the library, the boudoir, the
schoolroom, and the nursery; it is adopted as the happiest of manuals,
not only in Scotland, but wherever the English tongue is spoken; nay, it
is to be seen in the hands of old and young all over the civilised
world, and has, I have little doubt, extended the knowledge of Scottish
history in quarters where little or no interest had ever before been
awakened as to any other parts of that subject except those immediately
connected with Mary Stuart and the Chevalier.&quot;&mdash;<i>Life</i>, vol. ix. pp.

works has been sustained by the public demand during the term of legal
copyright and since that date. That of <i>Waverley</i> expired in 1856, and
the others at forty-two years from the date of publication.
</p><p>
On December 19, 1827, the copyright of the Novels from <i>Waverley</i> to
<i>Quentin Durward</i> was acquired, as mentioned in the text, for &pound;8400 as a
joint purchase. Five years later, viz., in 1832, Mr. Cadell purchased
from Sir Walter's representatives, for about &pound;40,000, the author's share
in stock and entire copyrights!
</p><p>
Nineteen years afterwards, viz., on the 26th March 1851 (after Mr.
Cadell's death), the stock and copyrights were exposed for sale by
auction in London, regarding which a Trade Journal of the date says&mdash;
</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Mr. Hodgson offered for sale the whole of the copyrights of Sir
     Walter Scott's works, including stereotypes, steels, woodcuts,
     etc., to a very large meeting of the publishers of this country.
     After one or two of our leading firms had retired from the contest,
     the lot was bought in for, we believe, &pound;15,500. This sum did not
     include the stock on hand, valued at &pound;10,000. However, the fact is
     that the Trustees have virtually refused &pound;25,000 for the stock,
     copyrights, etc., of Scott's works.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>
Messrs. A. &amp; C. Black in 1851 purchased the property at nearly the same
price, viz.:&mdash;Copyright, &pound;17,000; stock, &pound;10,000&mdash;in all, &pound;27,000. Mr.
Francis Black, who has kindly given me information regarding the sale of
these works, tells me that of the volumes of one of the cheaper issues
about three millions have been sold since 1851. This, of course, is
independent of other publishers' editions in Great Britain, the
Continent, and America.</p></div>

in Blackwood, for March 1828, Sir Walter's thoughts must have gone back
not only to Gourgaud's affair of the previous year, and to the more
serious matter of the <i>Beacon</i> newspaper in 1821,&mdash;when, to use Lord
Cockburn's words, &quot;it was dreadful to think that a life like Scott's was
for a moment in peril in such a cause&quot;&mdash;but he must also have had very
sad recollections of the bloody results of the two melancholy duels
arising from the same party rancour in February 1821 (Scott and
Christie) and in March 1822 (Stuart and Boswell), with all the untold
domestic miseries accompanying them. It is satisfactory to think that
this was about the last of these uncalled for literary onslaughts, as
one finds, in turning over the pages of <i>Blackwood</i>, that in 1834
Professor Wilson in the <i>Noctes</i> rebukes some one for reviving
&quot;forgotten falsehoods,&quot; praises Leigh Hunt's <i>London Journal</i>, and adds
the ecstatic words, which he also addressed later on to Lord Jeffrey,
&quot;The animosities are mortal, but the humanities live for ever.&quot;</p></div>

that Sir Walter, on leaving the room, whispered in her ear, &quot;Awa, awa,
the Deil's ower grit wi' you.&quot; &quot;To meet her in company,&quot; wrote Dr. John
Brown half a century later, when she was still the charm and the delight
as well as the centre of a large circle of friends, &quot;one saw a quiet,
unpretending, sensible, shrewd, kindly little lady; perhaps you would
not remark anything extraordinary in her, but let her <i>put on the old
lady</i>; it was as if a warlock spell had passed over her; not merely her
look but her nature was changed: her spirit had passed into the
character she represented; and jest, quick retort, whimsical fancy, the
wildest nonsense flowed from her lips, with a freedom and truth to
nature which appeared to be impossible in her own personality.&quot;
</p><p>
With this faculty for satire and imitation, Miss Graham never used it to
give pain. She was as much at home, too, with old Scotch sayings as Sir
Walter himself. For example, speaking of a field of cold, wet land she
said, &quot;It grat a' winter and girned a' simmer,&quot; and of herself one
morning at breakfast when she thought she was getting too much attention
from her guests (she was at this time over ninety) she exclaimed, &quot;I'm

<i>Life</i>, but as Scott was in London for some weeks in the spring of that
year he may have gone there on his return journey. Mr. Charles Knight,
writing in 1842, says that Mr. Bonnington, the venerable occupant of the
Gate House, told him that he remembered the visit and the visitor! It
was &quot;about twenty-five years ago&quot;&mdash;and after examining some carving in
the interior of the Gate House and putting many suggestive questions,
the middle-aged active stranger slightly lame, and with keen grey eye,
passed through the court and remained among the ruins silent and alone
for about two hours. (<i>Shakspeare</i>, vol. i. p. 89.) The famous romance
did not appear until six years later, viz. in January 1821, and in the
autumn of that year it is somewhat singular to find that Scott and his
friend Mr. Stewart Rose are at Stratford-on-Avon writing their names on
the wall of Shakespeare's birthplace&mdash;and yet leaving Kenilworth
unvisited.&mdash;Perhaps the reason was that Mr. Stewart Rose was not in the
secret of the authorship of the Novels.</p></div>

which Coleridge distinguished himself:&mdash;&quot;The first time I ever witnessed
it [Hook's improvisation] was at a gay young bachelor's villa near
Highgate, when the other lion was one of a very different breed, Mr.
Coleridge. Much claret had been shed before the <i>Ancient Mariner</i>
proclaimed that he could swallow no more of anything, unless it were
punch. The materials were forthwith produced; the bowl was planted
before the poet, and as he proceeded in his concoction, Hook, unbidden,
took his place at the piano. He burst into a bacchanal of egregious
luxury, every line of which had reference to the author of the <i>Lay
Sermons</i> and the <i>Aids to Reflection</i>. The room was becoming excessively
hot: the first specimen of the new compound was handed to Hook, who
paused to quaff it, and then, exclaiming that he was stifled, flung his
glass through the window. Coleridge rose with the aspect of a benignant
patriarch and demolished another pane&mdash;the example was followed
generally&mdash;the window was a sieve in an instant&mdash;the kind host was
furthest from the mark, and his goblet made havoc of the chandelier. The
roar of laughter was drowned in Theodore's resumption of the song&mdash;and
window and chandelier and the peculiar shot of each individual destroyer
had apt, in many cases exquisitely witty, commemoration. In walking home
with Mr. Coleridge, he entertained &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and me with a most excellent
lecture on the distinction between talent and genius, and declared that
Hook was as true a genius as Dante&mdash;<i>that</i> was his example.&quot;&mdash;<i>Theodore
Hook</i>, Lond. 1853, p. 23-4.</p></div>

Cathedral. This he had done often before; but he said he must stand once
more on the spot where he married poor mamma. After that we went to the
Castle, where a new showman went through the old trick of pointing out
Fergus MacIvor's <i>very</i> dungeon. Peveril said, 'Indeed, are you quite
sure, sir?' And on being told there could be no doubt, was troubled with
a fit of coughing, which ended in a laugh. The man seemed exceeding
indignant; so, when papa moved on, I whispered who it was. I wish you
had seen the man's start, and how he stared and bowed as he parted from
us; and then rammed his keys into his pocket and went off at a
hand-gallop to warn the rest of the garrison. But the carriage was
ready, and we escaped a row.&quot;&mdash;<i>Life</i>, vol. ix. pp. 256-7.</p></div>

</p><p>
He was at this time painting Sir Walter for the Royal Society of
Edinburgh. When the portrait was finished it was placed in the rooms of
the Society, where it still hangs. The artist retained in his own
collection a duplicate, with some slight variations, which his widow
presented to the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 1867.</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_235_235"></a><a href="#FNanchor_235_235">[235]</a><div class="note"><p> Sir Walter, in common with the majority of his
contemporaries, evidently believed that Dr. Robert Knox was partly
responsible for the West Port atrocities, but it is only just to the
memory of the talented anatomist to say that an independent and
influential committee, after a careful examination, reported on March
13th, 1829, that there was no evidence showing that he or his assistants
knew that murder had been committed, but the committee thought that more
care should have been exercised in the reception of the bodies at the
Anatomical Class-room.
</p><p>
Lord Cockburn, who was one of the counsel at the trial of Burke, in
writing of these events, remarks: &quot;All our anatomists incurred a most
unjust and very alarming, though not an unnatural, odium; Dr. Knox in
particular, against whom not only the anger of the populace, but the
condemnation of more intelligent persons, was specially directed. But,
tried in reference to the invariable and the necessary practice of the
profession, our anatomists were spotlessly correct, and Knox the most
correct of them all.&quot;
</p><p>
At this date Dr. Knox was the most popular teacher in the Medical School
at Edinburgh, and as his class-room could not contain more than a third
of his students, he had to deliver his lectures twice or thrice daily.
The odium attached to his name might have been removed in time had his
personal character stood as high as his professional ability, but though
he remained in Edinburgh until 1841 he never recovered his position
there, and for the last twenty years of his life this once brilliant
teacher subsisted as best he could in London by his pen, and as an
itinerant lecturer. He died in 1862.</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_249_249"></a><a href="#FNanchor_249_249">[249]</a><div class="note"><p> Sir Walter had written to Mr. Lockhart on October 26th,
1828, on hearing of an impending article in the <i>Quarterly</i>, the
following letter:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;I cannot repress the strong desire I have to express my regret at some
parts of your kind letter just received. I shall lament most truly a
<i>purple</i> article at this moment, when a strong, plain, moderate
statement, not railing at Catholics and their religion, but reprobating
the conduct of the Irish Catholics, and pointing out the necessary
effects which that conduct must have on the Catholic Question, would
have a powerful effect, and might really serve king and country. Nothing
the agitators desire so much as to render the broil general, as a
quarrel between Catholic and Protestant; nothing so essential to the
Protestant cause as to confine it to its real causes. Southey, as much a
fanatic as e'er a Catholic of them all, will, I fear, pass this most
necessary landmark of debate. I like his person, admire his genius, and
respect his immense erudition, but&mdash;<i>non omnia</i>. In point of reasoning
and political judgment he is a perfect Harpado&mdash;nothing better than a
wild bull. The circumstances require the interference of <i>vir gravis
pietate et moribus</i>, and you bring it a Highland piper to blow a
Highland charge, the more mischievous that it possesses much wild power
of inflaming the passions.
</p><p>
&quot;Your idea that you must give Southey his swing in this matter or he
will quit the <i>Review</i>,&mdash;this is just a pilot saying, If I do not give
the helm to such a passenger he will quit the ship. Let him quit and be
d&mdash;d.
</p><p>
&quot;My own confidence is, you know, entirely in the D. As Bruce said to the
Lord of the Isles at Bannockburn, 'My faith is constant in thee.' Now a
hurly-burly charge may derange his line of battle, and therein be of the
most fatal consequence. For God's sake avail yourself of the
communication I opened while in town, and do not act without it. Send
this to the D. of W. If you will, he will appreciate the motives that
dictate it. If he approves of a calm, moderate, but firm statement,
stating the unreasonable course pursued by the Catholics as the great
impediment to their own wishes, write such an article <i>yourself</i>; no one
can make a more impressive appeal to common sense than you can.
</p><p>
&quot;The circumstances of the times are&mdash;<i>must</i> be&mdash;an apology for
disappointing Southey. But nothing can be an apology for indulging him
at the expense of aggravating public disturbance, which, for one, I see
with great apprehension.
</p><p>
&quot;It has not yet come our length; those [to] whom you allude ought
certainly to be served, but the D. is best judge how they may be <i>best</i>
served. If the D. says nothing on the subject you can slip your
Derwentwater greyhound if you like. I write hastily, but most anxiously.
... I repeat that I think it possible to put the Catholic Question as it
now stands in a light which the most zealous of their supporters in this
country cannot but consider as fair, while the result would be that the
Question should not be granted at all under such guarantees; but I think
this is scarce to be done by inflaming the topic with all mutual
virulence of polemical discussion.&quot;</p></div>

engaged in the composition of the Novel of <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>, for
which purpose he wished to see a paper which I had some time before
contributed to the Memoirs of the Society of Antiquaries on the subject
of the Secret Tribunals of Germany, and upon which, accordingly, he
grounded the scene in the novel. Upon his describing to me the scheme
which he had formed for that work, I suggested to him that he might with
advantage connect the history of Ren&eacute;, king of Provence, which would
lead to many interesting topographical details which my residence in
that country would enable me to supply, besides the opportunity of
illustrating so eccentric a character as '<i>le bon roi Ren&eacute;</i>,' full of
traits which were admirably suited to Sir Walter's graphic style of
illustration, and that he could besides introduce the ceremonies of the
<i>F&ecirc;te Dieu</i> with great advantage, as I had fortunately seen its revival
the first time it was celebrated after the interruption of the
revolution. He liked the idea much, and, accordingly, a Journal which I
had written during my residence in Provence, with a volume of
accompanying drawings and Papon's History of Provence was forthwith sent
for, and the whole <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the story of <i>Anne o/Geierstein</i> was
changed, and the Provence part woven into it, in the form in which it
ultimately came forth.&quot;&mdash;<i>Reminiscences</i>.</p></div>

was no sort of call on the Duke after beating Buonaparte to go to war
with a booby. But he could not stand the fling at the fair. His
correspondence seems admirable every way, and the whole affair was gone
through in excellent taste,&mdash;the Duke and Hardinge trotting out, the two
peaceful lords rumbling down in a coach and four. The Duke had no
half-pence and was followed and bothered for some time by the tollman on
Battersea Bridge, when Hardinge fished out some silver or a groom came
up. There were various market gardeners on the road, who, when Lord
Winchelsea's equipage stopped, stopped also and looked on. One of them
advised a turn up with nature's weapons. The moment all was done the
Duke clapped spars to his horse and was back in Downing Street within
the two hours, breakfasted, and off to Windsor, where he transacted

in his nightcap at the Admiralty, colded badly, but in audacious
spirits. His business was this. The Duke of W[ellingto]n finds himself
without one newspaper <i>he</i> can depend on. He wishes to buy up some
evening print, such as the <i>dull Star</i>; and could I do anything for it?
I said I was as well inclined to serve the Duke as he could be, but it
must be in other fashion. He then said <i>he agreed</i> with me&mdash;but there
was a second question: Could I find them an editor, and undertake to
communicate between them and him&mdash;in short, save the Treasury the
inconvenience of maintaining an avowed intercourse with the Newspaper
press? He said he himself had for some years done this&mdash;then others. I
said I would endeavour to think of a man for their turn and would call
on him soon again.

&quot;I have considered the matter at leisure, and resolve to have nothing to
do with it. They CAN only want me as a <i>writer</i>. Any understrapper M.P.
would do well enough for carrying hints to a newspaper office, and I
will not, even to secure the Duke, mix myself up with the newspapers.
That work it is which has damned Croker, and I can't afford to sacrifice
the advantage which I feel I have gained in these later years by
abstaining altogether from partisan scribbling, or to subject the

read it the public mind required to be let gently down from the tone of
excitement to which it had been raised, and was contented to pause at my
book (<i>Richelieu</i>), as a man who has been enjoying a fine prospect from
a high hill stops before he reaches the valley to take another look,
though half the beauty be already lost.... You cannot think how I long
to acquit myself of the obligations which I lie under towards you, but I
am afraid that fortune, who has given you both the will and the power to
confer such great favours upon me, has not in any degree enabled me to
aid or assist you in return.&quot;</p></div>

</p><p>
&quot;My DEAR SIR THOMAS,&mdash;I received your kind letter and interesting
communication yesterday, and hasten to reply. I am ashamed of the

permitted me no more. I was much pleased with his lively and intelligent
manners, and hope he will live to be a comfort and a credit to Lady

&quot;I need not say I have the greatest interest in the MS. which you
mention. In case it shall really prove an authentic document, there
would not be the least difficulty in getting the Bannatyne Club to take,
perhaps, 100 copies, or obtaining support enough so as, at the least, to
preclude the possibility of loss to the ingenious Messrs. Hay Allan. But
I think it indispensable that the original MS. should be sent for a
month or so to the Register House under the charge of the Deputy
Register, Mr. Thomson, that its antiquity be closely scrutinised by
competent persons. The art of imitating ancient writing has got to a
considerable perfection, and it has been the bane of Scottish
literature, and disgrace of her antiquities, that we have manifested an
eager propensity to believe without inquiry and propagate the errors
which we adopt too hastily ourselves. The general proposition that the
Lowlanders ever wore plaids is difficult to swallow. They were of twenty
different races, and almost all distinctly different from the Scots
Irish, who are the proper Scots, from which the Royal Family are
descended. For instance, there is scarce a great family in the Lowlands
of Scotland that is not to be traced to the Normans, the proudest as
well as most civilised race in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Is it
natural to think that holding the Scots in the contempt in which they
did, they would have adopted their dress? If you will look at Bruce's
speech to David I., as the historian &AElig;lred tells the story, you will see
he talks of the Scots as a British officer would do of Cherokees. Or
take our country, the central and western part of the border: it was
British, Welsh if you please, with the language and manners of that
people who certainly wore no tartan. It is needless to prosecute this,
though I could show, I think, that there is no period in Scottish
History when the manners, language, or dress of the Highlanders were
adopted in the Low Country. They brought them with them from Ireland, as
you will see from the very curious prints in Derrick's picture of
Ireland, where you see the chiefs and followers of the wild Irish in the
ordinary Highland dress, <i>tempore</i> Queen Elizabeth. Besides this, where
has slept this universal custom that nowhere, unless in this MS., is it
even heard of? Lesley knew it not, though the work had been in his
possession, and his attention must have been called to it when writing
concerning the three races of Scots&mdash;Highlanders, Lowlanders, and
Bordermen, and treating of their dress in particular. Andrew Borde knows
nothing of it, nor the Frenchman who published the geographical work
from which Pinkerton copied the prints of the Highlander and Lowlander,
the former in a frieze plaid or mantle, while the Lowlander struts away
in a cloak and trunk hose, liker his neighbour the Fleming. I will not
state other objections, though so many occur, that the authenticity of
the MS. being proved, I would rather suppose the author had been some
tartan-weaver zealous for his craft, who wished to extend the use of
tartan over the whole kingdom. I have been told, and believe till now,
that the use of tartan was never general in Scotland (Lowlands) until
the Union, when the detestation of that measure led it to be adopted as
the national colour, and the ladies all affected tartan screens or
mantles.
</p><p>
&quot;Now, a word to your own private ear, my dear Sir Thomas. I have
understood that the Messrs. Hay Allan are young men of talent, great
accomplishments, enthusiasm for Scottish manners, and an exaggerating
imagination, which possibly deceives even themselves. I myself saw one
of these gentlemen wear the Badge of High Constable of Scotland, which
he could have no more right to wear than the Crown. Davidoff used also
to amuse us with stories of knighthoods and orders which he saw them
wear at Sir William Cumming Gordon's. Now this is all very well, and I
conceive people may fall into such dreaming habits easily enough, and be
very agreeable and talented men in other respects, and may be very
amusing companions in the country, but their authority as antiquaries
must necessarily be a little apocryphal when the faith of MSS. rests
upon their testimony. An old acquaintance of mine, Captain Watson of the
navy, told me he knew these gentlemen's father, and had served with him;
he was lieutenant, and of or about Captain Watson's age, between sixty I
suppose, and seventy at present. Now what chance was there that either
from age or situation he should be receiving gifts from the young
Chevalier of Highland Manuscripts.
</p><p>
&quot;All this, my dear Sir Thomas, you will make your own, but I cannot
conceal from you my reasons, because I would wish you to know my real
opinion. If it is an imitation, it is a very good one, but the title
'Liber Vestiarium' is false Latin I should think not likely to occur to
a Scotsman of Buchanan's age. Did you look at the watermark of the MS.?
If the Manuscript be of undeniable antiquity, I consider it as a great
curiosity, and most worthy to be published. But I believe nothing else
than ocular inspection will satisfy most cautious
antiquaries....&mdash;Yours, my dear Sir Thomas, always,
</p><p>

The Messrs. Hay Allan subsequently took the names of John Sobieski
Stuart (who assumed the title of Comte d'Albanie) and Charles Edward
Stuart. John Sobieski died in 1872, and Charles Edward in 1880. The
&quot;original&quot; of Sir Richard Forrester's manuscript was never submitted to
the inspection of the Deputy Register, as suggested by Scott; but it was
published in a very handsome shape a dozen years later, and furnished a

that the following may be given relating to the <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>:&mdash;
</p><blockquote><p>&quot;EDIN. <i>Sept</i>. 1, 1829.
</p><p>
     &quot;MY DEAR SIR WALTER,&mdash;I greet you well (which, by the way, is the
     proper mode of salutation in this cursed weather, that is enough to
     make us all greet). But to come to my proposal, which is to forward
     to you a communication I had within these few days from Sir Robert
     Horne Dalrymple Elphinstone.
</p><p>
     &quot;After expressing the great pleasure the perusal of your notes to
     the new edition of the Novels had given him, he adds: 'I wish you
     would give him a hint of what I formerly mentioned to you regarding
     my great-grandaunt and your own relative, the unfortunate Bride of
     Lammermoor. It was first mentioned to me by Miss Maitland, the
     daughter of Lady Rothes (they were the nearest neighbours of the
     Stair family in Wigtownshire), and I afterwards heard the tradition
     from others in that country. It was to the following effect, that
     when, after the noise and violent screaming in the bridal chamber,
     comparative stillness succeeded, and the door was forced, the
     window was found open, and it was supposed by many that the lover
     (Lord Rutherford) had, by the connivance of some of the servants,
     found means, during the bustle of the marriage feast, to secrete
     himself within the apartment, and that soon after the entry of the
     married pair, or at least as soon as the parents and others
     retreated and the door was made fast, he had come out from his
     concealment, attacked and desperately wounded the bridegroom, and
     then made his escape by the window through the garden. As the
     unfortunate bride never spoke after having uttered the words
     mentioned by Sir Walter, no light could be thrown on the matter by
     them. But it was thought that Bucklaw's obstinate silence on the
     subject favoured the supposition of the chastisement having been
     inflicted by his rival. It is but fair to give the unhappy victim
     (who was by all accounts a most gentle and feminine creature) the
     benefit of an explanation on a doubtful point.'
</p><p>
     &quot;So far my worthy friend, who seems a little jealous of the poor
     bride's reputation. I send you his note, and you can make what you
     like of it. I am intending a little jaunt to his country, and we
     mean to visit sundry old castles in Aberdeenshire, and wish you
     were of the party. I have heard nothing of Linton [cognomen for Sir
     Adam Ferguson] this summer. I hope you have been passing your time
     agreeably.&mdash;With best compliments to all friends, I remain, my dear
     Sir Walter, ever yours,
</p><p>

elbow and says he has not the face to bother you, but he has come
exactly to the part where your reminiscences of Lord Byron would come
in; so he is waiting for a week or so in case they should be
forthcoming.&quot; And Moore himself had previously reminded Sir Walter of
his promise.
</p><blockquote><p><i>April 25th</i>, 1829.
</p><p>
     &quot;My DEAR SCOTT,&mdash;It goes to my heart to bother you, knowing how
     bravely and gloriously you are employed for that
     task-mistress&mdash;Posterity. But you may thank your stars that I have
     let you off so long. All that you promised me about Mrs. Gordon and
     Gicht, and a variety of other things, is remitted to you; but I
     positively <i>must</i> have something from you of your recollections
     personally of Byron&mdash;and that as soon as possible, for I am just
     coming to the period of your acquaintance with him, which was, I
     think, in the year 1814. Tell me all the particulars of the
     presents you exchanged, and if his letters to you are really <i>all</i>
     lost (which I will still hope is not the case); try, as much as
     possible, with your memory
</p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'To lure the tassel gentles back again.'<br /></span>
</div></div><p>
     &quot;You will have seen by the newspapers the sad loss my little circle
     of home has experienced, a loss never to be made up to us in this
     world, whatever it may be the will of God in another. Mrs. Moore's
     own health is much broken, and she is about to try what Cheltenham
     can do for her, while I proceed to finish my printing in town. It
     would be far better for me to remain in my present quiet retreat,
     where I am working quite alone, but the devils beckon me nearer
     them, and I must begin in a few days. Direct to me, under cover to
     Croker&mdash;you see I take for granted you will have a packet to
     send&mdash;and he will always know where to find me.
</p><p>
     &quot;My kindest remembrances to Miss Scott, and believe me ever, my
     very dear friend, your truly and affectionate,
</p><p>
     &quot;THOS. MOORE.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>
The &quot;memoranda&quot; were not acknowledged by Moore till Oct. 31, when he
wrote Scott as follows:&mdash;
</p><blockquote><p>&quot;MY DEAR SCOTT,&mdash;I ought to blush 'terrestrial rosy-red, shame's
     proper hue' for not sooner acknowledging your precious notes about
     Byron. One conclusion, however, you might have drawn from my
     silence, namely, that I was satisfied, and had all that I asked
     for. Your few pages indeed will be the best ornament of my book.
     Murray wished me to write to you (immediately on receipt of the
     last MS. you sent me) to press your asking Hobhouse for the letter
     of your own (in 1812) that produced Byron's reply. But I was
     doubtful whether you would like to authorise the publication of
     this letter, and besides it would be now too late, as the devils
     are in full hue and cry after my heels.
</p><p>
     &quot;Health and prosperity to you, my dear friend, and believe me, ever
     yours most truly,
</p><p>

which may be given here:&mdash;
</p><blockquote><p>&quot;MY DEAR SKENE,&mdash;I enclose you Basil Hall's letter, which is very
     interesting to me; but I would rather decline fixing the attention
     of the public further on my old friend George Constable. You know
     the modern rage for publication, and it might serve some newsmen's
     purpose by publishing something about my old friend, who was an
     humourist, which may be unpleasing to his friends and surviving
     relations.
</p><p>
     &quot;I did not think on Craignethan in writing about Tillietudlem, and
     I believe it differs in several respects from my Chateau en
     Espagne. It is not on the Clyde in particular, and, if I recollect,
     the view is limited and wooded. But that can be no objection to
     adopting it as that which public taste has adopted as coming
     nearest to the ideal of the place. Of the places in the <i>Black
     Dwarf,</i> Meiklestane Moor, Ellislie, Earnscliffe, are all and each
     <i>vox et, praeterea nihil</i>. Westburnflat once was a real spot, now
     there is no subject for the pencil. The vestiges of a tower at the
     junction of two wild brooks with a rude hillside, are all that are
     subjects for the pencil, and they are very poor ones. Earnscliffe
     and Ganderscleuch are also visions.

Purdie identified himself with all his master's pursuits and concerns;
he had in early life been a shepherd, and came into Sir Walter's service
upon his first taking up his abode at Ashiestiel, of which he became at
last the farm manager; and upon the family removing to Abbotsford
continued that function, to which was added gamekeeper, forester,
librarian, and henchman to his master in all his rambles about the
property. He used to talk of Sir Walter's publications as <i>our</i> books,
and said that the reading of them was the greatest comfort to him, for
whenever he was off his sleep, which sometimes happened to him, he had
only to take one of the novels, and before he read two pages it was sure
to set him asleep. Tom, with the usual shrewdness common to his
countrymen in that class of life, joined a quaintness and drollery in
his notions and mode of expressing himself that was very amusing; he was
familiar, but at the same time perfectly respectful, although he was
sometimes tempted to deal sharp cuts, particularly at Sir Adam Ferguson,
whom he seemed to take a pleasure in assailing. When Sir Walter obtained
the honour of knighthood for Sir Adam, upon the plea of his being
Custodier of the Regalia of Scotland, Tom was very indignant, because he
said, 'It would take some of the shine out of us,' meaning Sir Walter.
Tom was very fond of salmon fishing, which from an accordance of taste
contributed much to elevate my merits in his eyes, and I believe I was
his greatest favourite of all Sir Walter's friends, which he used
occasionally to testify by imparting to me in confidence some secret
about fishing, which he concluded that no one knew but himself. He was
remarkably fastidious in his care of the Library, and it was exceedingly
amusing to see a clodhopper (for he was always in the garb of a
ploughman) moving about in the splendid apartment which had been fitted
up for the Library, scrutinising the state of the books, putting
derangement to rights, remonstrating when he observed anything that
indicated carelessness.&quot;</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_362_364"></a><a href="#FNanchor_362_364">[362]</a><div class="note"><p> Of this illness, Sir Walter had written the following
account to Mr. Lockhart, a week after its occurrence:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;Anne would tell you of an awkward sort of fit I had on Monday last; it
lasted about five minutes, during which I lost the power of
articulation, or rather of speaking what I wished to say. I revived
instantly, but submitted to be bled, and to keep the house for a week,
except exercising walks. They seem to say it is from the stomach. It may
or may not be a paralytic affection. We must do the best we can in
either event. I think by hard work I will have all my affairs regulated
within five or six years, and leave the means of clearing them in case
of my death. I hope there will be enough for all, and provision besides
for my own family. The present return of the novels to me is about &pound;8000
a year, which moves fast on to clear off old scores.
</p><p>
&quot;This awkward turn of health makes my motions very uncertain. On the one
hand I want to save money and push forward work, both which motives urge
me to stay at home this spring. On the other, besides my great wish to
see you all, and besides my desire to look at the 'forty-five' affairs,
I am also desirous to put in for my interest upon the changes at the
Court.... It must be very much as health and weather shall determine,
for if I see the least chance of a return of this irritation, my own
house will be the only fit place for me. Do not suppose I am either
low-spirited or frightened at the possibilities I calculate upon, but
there is no harm in looking at what may be as what needs must be. I
really believe the ugly symptoms proceed from the stomach particularly.
I feel, thank God, no mental injury, which is most of all to be
deprecated. Still, I am a good deal failed in body within these two or
three last years, and the <i>singula praedantur</i> come by degrees to make
up a sum. They say, 'Do not work,' but my habits are such that it is not
easily managed, for I would be driven mad with idleness.... Adieu. Love
to all. The odds are greatly against my seeing you till you come down
here, but I will have the cottage in such order for you; and as Will
Laidlaw comes back at Whitsunday, I will have him to lend me an arm to
Chiefswood, and I have no doubt to do gallantly.

this time, and Sir Walter had expressed his opinion a few days before
their meeting:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;Your letter, this day received, namely Wednesday, gave me the greatest
pleasure on account of the prosperous intelligence which it gives me of
your own advancing prospects.... I take it for granted that you have
looked to the income of future years before thinking of disposing of the
profits of a successful one in a manner which cannot be supposed to
produce positive Or direct advantage, but may rather argue some
additional degree of expense.
</p><p>
&quot;But this being <i>premeesed</i>, I cannot help highly approving of your
going into Parliament, especially as a member entirely unfettered and
left to act according to the weal of the public, or what you conceive
such. It is the broad turnpike to importance and consequence which you,
as a man of talents in the full vigour of your youth, ought naturally to
be ambitious of. The present times threaten to bring in many occasions
when there will and must be opportunities of a man distinguishing
himself and serving his country.
</p><p>
&quot;To go into the House without speaking would be useless. I will frankly
tell you that when I heard you speak you seemed always sufficiently up
to the occasion both in words and matter, but too indifferent in the
manner in which you pressed your argument, and therefore far less likely
to attract attention than if you had seemed more earnestly persuaded of
the truth and importance of what you have been saying. I think you may
gain advantage from taking this hint. No one is disposed to weigh any
man's arguments more favourably than he himself does, and if you are not
considered as gravely interested in what you say, and conscious of its
importance, your audience will not be so....

following letter:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;DEAR SKENE,&mdash;I observe from the papers that our invaluable friend is no
more. I have reason to think, that as I surmised when I saw him last,
the interval has been a melancholy one, at least to those who had to
watch the progress. I never expected to see his kind face more, after I
took leave of him in Charlotte Square; yet the certainty that such must
be the case is still a painful shock, as I can never hope again to meet,
during the remaining span of my own life, a friend in whom high talents
for the business of life were more happily mingled with all those
affections which form the dearest part of human intercourse. In that
respect I believe his like hardly is to be found. I hope Mrs. Skene and
you will make my assurance of deep sympathy, of which they know it is
expressed by a friend of poor Colin of fifty years' standing.
</p><p>
&quot;I hope my young friend, his son, will keep his father's example before
his eyes. His best friend cannot wish him a better model.
</p><p>
&quot;I am just setting off to the West for a long-promised tour of a week. I
shall be at Abbotsford after Monday, 27th current, and I hope Mrs. Skene
and you, with some of our young friends, will do us the pleasure to come
here for a few days. We see how separations may happen among friends,
and should not neglect the opportunity of being together while we can.
Besides, <i>entre nous</i>, it is time to think what is to be done about the
Society, as the time of my retirement draws nigh, and I am determined,
at whatever loss, not to drag out the last sands of my life in that
sand-cart of a place, the Parliament House. I think it hurt poor Colin.
This is, however, subject for future consideration, as I have not
breathed a syllable about resigning the Chair to any one, but it must
soon follow as a matter of course.<a name="FNanchor_C_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_398"><sup>[C]</sup></a>

the Court of Session, and his old friend responded in the following
cordial letter:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;<i>November, 1830</i>.
</p><p>
&quot;MY DEAR SCOTT,&mdash;... I am sorry to read what you tell me of your
lameness, but legs are not so obedient to many of us at our age as they
were twenty years ago, <i>non immunes ab illis malis sumus</i>, as the
learned Partridge and Lilly's Grammar tells us. I find mine swell, and
am forced to bandage, and should not exert them with impunity in walking
as I used to do, either in long walks or in rough ground. I am glad,
however, you have escaped from the Court of Session, even at the risk of
sometimes feeling the want you allude to of winter society. You think
you shall tire of solitude in these months: and in spite of books and
the love of them, I have discovered by experience the possibility of
such a feeling; but can we not in some degree remedy this? Why should we
both be within two days' march of each other and not sometimes together,
as of old? How I have enjoyed in your house the <i>summum bonum</i> of Sir
Wm. Temple's philosophy, 'something which is not Home and yet with the
liberty of Home, which is not Solitude, and yet hath the ease of
Solitude, and which is only found in the house of an old friend.' Our
summer months are well provided with summer friends. You have plenty and
to spare of sightseers, Lions, and their hunters, and I have travellers,
moor-shooters, etc., in equal abundance, but now when the country is
abandoned, and Walter is leaving you, how I wish you would bring dear
Anne and partake for a while our little circle here&mdash;we stir not till
Christmas&mdash;if before that time such a pleasure could be attainable.
Well, then, for auld lang syne, will you not, now that the Session has
no claim on you, combine our forces against the possibility of <i>ennui</i>.
If you will do this, I will positively, and in good faith, hold myself
in readiness to do as much by you in the next November, and in every
alternate November, nor shall the month ever pass without bringing us
together. Do not tell me, as Wm. Rose would not fail to do if I gave him
so good an opportunity, that my proposal would be a greater bore than
the solitude it destroyed. It shall be no such thing, but only the
trouble of a journey. I feel too, as I grow older, the <i>vis inerti&aelig;</i>,
and fancy that locomotion is more difficult, but let us abjure the
doctrine, for it baulks much pleasure. Pray&mdash;pray as the children
say&mdash;come to us, think of it first as not impossible, then weigh fairly
the objections, and if they resolve themselves into mere aversion to
change, overcome them by an assurance that the very change will give
value to the resumption of your home avocations. If I plead thus
strongly, perhaps it is because I feel the advantage to myself. Time has
made gaps in the list of old friends as in yours; young ones, though
very cheering and useful, are not, and cannot be, the same. I enjoy them
too when present, but in absence I regret the others. What remains but
to make the most of those we have still left when both body and mind
permit us [to enjoy] them. I have books; also a room that shall [be your
own], and a [pony] off which I can shoot, which I will engage shall
neither tumble himself or allow you to tumble in any excursion on which
you may venture. Dear Anne will find and make my womenkind as happy as
you will make me, and we have only to beg you to stay long and be most
cordially welcome. ... Adieu, dear Scott. I fear you will not come for
all I can say. I could almost lose a tooth or a finger (if it were
necessary) to find myself mistaken. Come, and come soon; stay long; be
assured of welcome.
</p><p>
&quot;All unite in this and in love to you and Anne, with your assured
friend,
</p><p>
J.B. MORRITT.&quot;</p></div>

on the 18th, bringing with them the good news from Edinburgh of the
payment of the second dividend, and of the handsome conduct of the
creditors. There had been a painful discussion between them and Sir
Walter during the early part of the winter on <i>Count Robert of Paris</i>,
particulars of which are given in <i>the Life</i> (vol. x. pp. 6, 10-17,
21-23), but they found their host much better than they had ventured to
anticipate, and he made the gift of his library the chief subject of
conversation during the evening. Next morning Mr. Ballantyne was asked
to read aloud a political essay on Reform&mdash;intended to be a <i>Fourth
Epistle of Malachi</i>. After careful consideration, the critical arbiters
concurred in condemning the production, but suggested a compromise. His
friends left him on the 21st, and the essay, though put in type, was

&quot;displenished&quot; in 1826, Scott sent him the full-length portrait of
himself by Raeburn, now at Abbotsford, saying that he did not hesitate
to claim his protection for the picture, which was threatened to be
paraded under the hammer of the auctioneer, and he felt that his
interposition to turn aside that buffet might admit of being justified.
&quot;As a piece of successful art, many might fancy the acquisition, but for
the sake of the original he knew no refuge where it was likely to find a
truer welcome. The picture accordingly remained many years in my
possession, but when his health had begun to break, and the plan of his
going abroad was proposed, I thought it would be proper to return the
picture, for which purpose I had a most successful copy made of it, an
absolute facsimile, for when the two were placed beside each, other it
was almost impossible to determine which was the original and which the
copy.&quot;&mdash;<i>Reminiscences</i>. Thus forestalling the wish expressed in the
affecting letter now given, which belongs to this day. See <i>ante</i>, vol.
i. p. 136 <i>n</i>.
</p><p>
&quot;MY DEAR SKENE,&mdash;I have had no very pleasant news to send you, as I know
it will give Mrs. Skene and you pain to know that I am suffering under a
hundred little ailments which have greatly encroached upon the custom of
the season which I used to take. On this I could say much, but it is
better to leave alone what must be said with painful feeling, and you
would be vexed with reading.
</p><p>
&quot;One thing I will put to rights with all others respecting my little
personal affairs. I am putting [in order] this house with what it
contains, and as Walter will probably be anxious to have a memorial of
my better days, I intend to beg you and my dear Mrs. Skene ... to have
it [the picture] copied by such an artist as you should approve of, to
supply the blank which must then be made on your hospitable walls with
the shadow of a shade. If the opportunity should occur of copying the
picture to your mind, I will be happy to have the copy as soon as
possible. You must not think that I am nervous or foolishly apprehensive
that I take these precautions. They are necessary and right, and if one
puts off too long, we sometimes are unfit for the task when we desire to
take it up....
</p><p>
&quot;When the weather becomes milder, I hope Mrs. Skene and you, and some of
the children, will come out to brighten the chain of friendship with
your truly faithful,

1832, was still desirous to promote Hogg's welfare. In writing from
Naples he says, in reference to the Shepherd's social success in London,
&quot;I am glad Hogg has succeeded so well. I hope he will make hay while the
sun shines; but he must be aware that the Lion of this season always
becomes the Boar of the next.... I will subscribe the proper sum, <i>i.e.</i>
what you think right, for Hogg, by all means; and I pray God, keep farms
and other absurd temptations likely to beset him out of his way. He has

painted, was not only the friend of Scott, but she held relations more
or less close with nearly every one famous in Art and Literature during
the greater part of the nineteenth century. No mean artist herself, and
though, perhaps, not a clever letter-writer, she had among her
correspondents some of the most brilliant men of her day. She survived
all her early friends, but had the gift of being attractive to the
young, and for three generations was the delight of their children and
grandchildren. Those who were privileged to share in the refined
hospitality of Winton, never forgot either the picturesque old house
(the supposed Ravenswood Castle of the <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>), or its
venerable mistress as she sat of an evening in her unique drawing-room,
the walls of which were adorned with pictures of Grecian temple and
landscape, her own handiwork in days long gone by when she was styled by
her friends Queen of Athens. Her conversation, after she was ninety, was
fresh and vigorous; and, despite blindness and imperfect hearing, she
kept herself well acquainted with the affairs of the day. The last great
speech in Parliament, or the newest <i>bon mot</i>, were equally acceptable
and equally relished. Her sense of humour and fun made her, at times,
forget her own sufferings, and her splendid memory enabled her to while
away many a sleepless hour by repeating long passages from the Bible or
Milton. The former she had so much in her heart that it was scarcely
possible to believe she was not reading from the Book. Above all was her
truly divine gift of charity, the practical application of which, in her
every-day life, was only bounded by her means.
</p><p>
It was said of her by one who knew her well&mdash;
</p><blockquote><p>&quot;She lived to a great age, dispensing kindness and benevolence to
     the last, and cheered in the sore infirmities of her later years by
     the love of friends of all ranks, and all parties of all ages.
</p><p>
     &quot;The Living Lamp of Lothian, which from Winton, has so long shed
     its beneficent lustre, has been extinguished, but not so will be
     lost the memory of the gifted lady, for by not a few will still be
     cherished the recollection of her noble nature, and of her
     Christian life.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>
Lady Ruthven prized the picture referred to. She would not, as Sir
Francis Grant relates,<a name="FNanchor_D_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_448"><sup>[D]</sup></a> permit him to touch the canvas after it left
the Abbotsford studio; and it remained a cherished possession which she
took pride in showing to appreciative guests, pointing out the details
of face and form which she still saw with that inner eye, which time had
not darkened.
</p><p>
It is now in the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland&mdash;bequeathed to
the nation with other pictures, as well as the magnificent collection of
Greek archaeological objects gathered by herself and Lord Ruthven in
their early married life. She was born in 1789, and died in 1885.</p></div>

son of Scott's dear friend, has been good enough to give me his
recollections of these days:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;On referring to my Diary for the year 1831 I find the following entry:
'This Spring, on 31st April, I went with my father to Abbotsford and
left on Sir Walter Scott being taken ill.' The date here given for my
visit does not correspond with that in Sir Walter's Diary, but, as there
are only thirty days in April it has evidently been written by mistake
for the 13th. I had just attained my twenty-first year, and as such a
visit at that early age was a great event in my life, I retain a very
distinct recollection of the main features of it. I recollect that Lord
Meadowbank and his eldest son Alan came at the same time, and the dinner
party, at which Mr. Pringle of the Haining and his brother were present.
The day after our arrival Sir Walter asked me to drive with him. We went
in his open carriage to the Yarrow, where we got out, and Sir Walter,
leaning on my arm, walked up the side of the river, pouring forth a
continuous stream of anecdotes, traditions, and scraps of ballads. I was
in the seventh heaven of delight, and thought I had never spent such a
day. On Sunday Sir Walter did not come down to breakfast, but sent a
message to say that he had caught cold and had taken some medicine for
it the night before, which had made him ill, and would remain in bed.
When we sat at either lunch or dinner, I do not recollect which, Sir
Walter walked into the room and sat down near the table, but ate
nothing. He seemed in a dazed state, and took no notice of any one, but
after a few minutes' silence, during which his daughter Anne, who was at
table, and was watching him with some anxiety, motioned to us to take no
notice, he began in a quiet voice to tell us a story of a pauper
lunatic, who, fancying he was a rich man, and was entertaining all sorts
of high persons to the most splendid banquets, communicated to his
doctor in confidence that there was one thing that troubled him much,
and which he could not account for, and that was that all these
exquisite dishes seemed to him to taste of oatmeal porridge. Sir Walter
told this with much humour, and after a few minutes' silence began
again, and told the same story over a second time, and then again a
third time.<a name="FNanchor_E_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_459"><sup>[E]</sup></a> His daughter, who was watching him with increasing
anxiety, then motioned to us to rise from table, and persuaded her
father to return to his bedroom. Next day the doctor, who had been sent
for, told us that he was seriously ill, and advised that his guests
should leave at once, so that the house might be kept quiet and his
daughter devote herself entirely to the care of her father. We
accordingly left at once, and I never saw Sir Walter again. I still,
however, retain a memorial of my visit. I had fallen into indifferent
health in the previous year, and been recommended Highland air. By Sir
Walter's advice I was sent to live with a friend of his, the Reverend
Doctor Macintosh Mackay, then minister of Laggan, in the Inverness-shire
Highlands, and had passed my time learning from him the Gaelic language.
This excited in me a taste for Celtic Antiquities, and finding in Sir
Walter's Library a copy of O'Connor's <i>Rerum Hibernicarum Scriptores
veteres</i>, I sat up one night transcribing from it the Annals of
Tighernac. This transcript is still in my library.&mdash;WILLIAM F. SKENE.

following inscription for the monument he had commissioned, and which
now stands in the churchyard of Irongray:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;This stone was erected by the Author of Waverley to the memory of Helen
Walker, who died in the year of God 1791. This humble individual
practised in real life the virtues with which fiction has invested the
imaginary character of Jeanie Deans; refusing the slightest departure
from veracity, even to save the life of a sister, she nevertheless
showed her kindness and fortitude, in rescuing her from the severity of
the law, at the expense of personal exertions, which the time rendered
as difficult as the motive was laudable. Respect the grave of Poverty
when combined with the love of Truth and dear affection.&quot;
</p><p>
It is well known that on the publication of <i>Old Mortality</i> many people
were offended by what was considered a caricature of the Covenanters,
and that Dr. M'Crie, the biographer of Knox, wrote a series of papers in
the <i>Edinburgh Christian Instructor</i>, which Scott affected to despise,
and said he would not read. He not only was obliged to read the
articles, but found it necessary to inspire or write an elaborate
defence of the truth of his own picture of the Covenanters in the Number
for January 1817 of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>.
</p><p>
In June 1818, however, he made ample amends, and won the hearts of all
classes of his countrymen by his beautiful pictures of national
character in the <i>Heart of Midlothian</i>.
</p><p>
It is worth noticing also that ten years later, viz., in December 1828,
his friend Richardson having written that in the <i>Tales of a
Grandfather</i> &quot;You have paid a debt which you owed to the manes of the
Covenanters for the flattering picture which you drew of Claverhouse in
<i>Old Mortality</i>. His character is inconceivable to me: the atrocity of
his murder of those peasants, as undauntedly devoted to their own good
cause as himself to his, his personal (almost hangman-like)
superintendence of their executions, are wholly irreconcilable with a
chivalrous spirit, which, however scornful of the lowly, could never, in
my mind, be cruel,&quot; Scott, in reply, gave his matured opinion in the
following words:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;As to Covenanters and Malignants, they were both a set of cruel and
bloody bigots, and had, notwithstanding, those virtues with which
bigotry is sometimes allied. Their characters were of a kind much more
picturesque than beautiful; neither had the least idea either of
toleration or humanity, so that it happens that, so far as they can be
distinguished from each other, one is tempted to hate most the party
which chances to be uppermost for the time.&quot;</p></div>

regarding this Arabian conjurer, and writing to Mr. Lockhart, on Nov.
1831, in the following terms:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;I have got a key to the conjuring story of Alexandria and Grand Cairo.
I have seen very distinct letters of Sir John Stoddart's son, who
attended three of the formal exhibitions which broke down, though they
were repeated afterwards with success. Young Stoddart is an excellent
Arabian scholar&mdash;an advantage which I understand is more imperfectly
enjoyed by Lord Prudhoe and Colonel Felix. Much remains to be explained,
but the boldness of the attempt exceeds anything since the days of the
Automaton chess-player, or the Bottle conjurer. The first time
Shakespeare was evoked he appeared in the complexion of an Arab. This
seems to have been owing to the first syllable of his name, which
resembled the Arabian word <i>Sheik</i>, and suggested the idea of an Arabian
chief to the conjurer. A gentleman named Galloway has bought the secret,
and talks of being frightened. There can be little doubt that, having so
far interested himself, it would become his interest to put the conjurer
more up to the questions likely to be asked. So he was more perfect when
consulted by Lord Prudhoe than at first, when he made various blunders,
and when we must needs say <i>falsum in uno falsum in omnibus</i>. As all
this will come out one day, I have no wish to mingle in the
controversy.... There are still many things to explain, but I think the
mystery is unearthed completely.&quot;
